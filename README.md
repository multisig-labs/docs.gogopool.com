# ðŸŽˆ Mission

### Our Mission

**Accelerating the worldâ€™s transition to blockchain technology** â€” at GoGoPool, we are committed to this visionary goal. We believe the quickest path to achieving this is by expanding and simplifying the launch of blockchains within the Avalanche ecosystem.

#### **Why We Believe in Custom Blockchains Powered with Avalanche's Subnet Technology:**

Custom blockchains empower creators with exceptional control over their own chains. This setup not only offers links to the broader blockchain network but also provides infinite scalability and the flexibility to tailor networks to specific operational and regulatory needs.

These custom blockchains allow creators to define their own rules, manage privacy settings, and even set specific hardware requirements for validators to ensure optimal performance and security. This adaptability makes them highly effective for diverse applications, fostering innovation and growth in the blockchain space.

For those looking to harness the power of subnets, GoGoPool is here to simplify your journey, providing the tools and guidance needed to launch and manage your custom blockchain efficiently.

### **Core Products to Achieve Our Mission**

Aligned with our mission to make developing, launching, and managing blockchains as effortless as possible, GoGoPool offers a suite of core products designed to lower entry barriers and foster innovation within the blockchain space. A critical component of launching custom blockchains is ensuring reliable validators, a challenge we address through our first two products:

*   **Liquid Staking**: Through liquid staking, GoGoPool allows users to stake their `AVAX` and earn returns without locking up their assets. They receive `ggAVAX`, which they can trade anytime, providing flexibility along with earning potential.

    Due to its innovative structure, `ggAVAX` is the highest-yielding LST on Avalanche.
* **Validator Launching** (a.k.a Minipools): Users can easily become a validator on Avalanche with almost half of AVAX normally required and minimal hassle. Thanks to the One-Click launcher, users don't even have to think about running a node themselves. This makes becoming a validator more accessible for everyone.
* **Blockchain Integration**: GoGoPool also supports projects looking to launch their own blockchains by quickly connecting them with reliable validators (a.k.a. Minipool operators), facilitating seamless launches and scalable growth. This is where most of our development efforts are currently focused, as we strive to enhance the blockchain integration process.

GoGoPool simplifies blockchain engagement by making the Avalanche network more accessible, from staking `AVAX` to launching validators and custom blockchains. Our approach focuses on validating custom blockchains, which are crucial for decentralization, yield, and security.
