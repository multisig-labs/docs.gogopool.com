# Managing Your COQ Staking and Rewards on Coqnet

Once you’ve staked COQ and rented a node to become a validator on Coqnet, you can track your staking rewards and manage your stakes through the L1 Marketplace. This guide explains how to manage your stakes and rewards.

***

## Manage Your COQ Staking and Rewards

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Visit the Coqnet Marketplace Page

* Go to the **Coqnet** project page on the L1 Marketplace.
* The **Staking Widget** will now display two new cards: **My Rewards** and **My Stake**.

> If you haven’t staked yet, follow the [staking process](coqnet-climax-how-to-stake-coq-and-become-a-validator.md) to become a validator.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### View Your Rewards Details

In the **My Rewards** card, you’ll see:

* **Accrued Rewards**: The total amount of rewards owed for all your active validators.
* **Unlock Date**: The next eligible date to claim rewards from one of your validators.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### View Your Staking Details

In the **My Stake** card, you’ll see:

* **Total Staked COQ**: The total amount of COQ you’ve staked across all nodes.
* **Reward Rate**: The APY for your staking period.
* **Claimable Staked COQ**: The total amount of tokens eligible to be unstaked after the validation period ends.
* **Estimated Rewards**: The projected rewards based on your staked amount and APY.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Claim and Unstake Rewards

Once the **Unlock Date** has passed, you can claim your rewards.

* Click the **Claim & Unstake** button in the **My Rewards** card.
* If you have multiple claimable balances (from different stakes), select the unlocked balance you’d like to claim.
* Approve two consecutive transactions in your wallet:
  * The first transaction **unstakes** your COQ.
  * The second transaction **claims** your rewards.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}
