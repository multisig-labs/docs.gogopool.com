# ðŸ¥© COQNet CLIMAX: How to Stake COQ and Become a Validator

This guide explains how to stake COQ tokens and become a validator on COQnet via GoGoPoolâ€™s [L1 Marketplace (L1M)](https://l1s.gogopool.com/marketplace) without dealing with technical complexities. By following these step-by-step instructions, you can participate in the staking campaign and earn rewards on COQnet.

## Key Concepts on COQ Staking

### Node Availability

The amount of nodes available for staking on COQnet is limited. Hereâ€™s how it works:

* Nodes are released in **batches** at different times.
* A user can only stake if nodes are available in the current batch.
* The **Staking Widget** on the COQnet project page shows how many nodes are remaining in the current batch. Once all nodes in a batch are staked, youâ€™ll need to wait for the next batch to be released.

> Keep an eye on the Staking Widget to know when new batches are available.

### Batch Details

* BATCH 1: Early whitelist for community members and builders to give engineering feedback - up to 20 spots
* BATCH 2: Whitelist created from X engagements on announcement post - up to 180 spots
* BATCH 3: Open to all eligible users, first come, first serve - up to 1000 spots

### Wallet Eligibility

To stake COQ, your wallet must meet the following criteria:

* **Chill Factor Score**: Only wallets with a Chill Factor score **above 69,420** can stake.

_The Chill Factor score is based on your walletâ€™s activity and history within the Avalanche ecosystem. You can check your wallet's Chill Factor score_ [_here_](https://frostymetrics.com/chill_factor)_._

### Staking Limits

Each wallet has the following staking limits:

* You can stake a maximum of once for BATCH1/BATCH2 and three times for BATCH3, meaning you can run up to **three validator nodes** per wallet.
* Once youâ€™ve reached the maximum limit, you wonâ€™t be able to stake additional COQ from the same wallet.

### Staking Parameters

Staking on COQnet has the following parameters:

* **APY**: 9000%
* **Staking Duration**: 30 days
* **Staking Amount**: 20,000,000 COQ (fixed and non-changeable)
* **Fees**:
  * **P-Chain PAYG (Pay-as-you-go) Fee**: 1.33 AVAX (the fee of being a L1-only validator on the Avalanche network for one month).
  * **Node Fee**: $40 USD, paid in AVAX (paid to the hardware provider to set up and run a node on users behalf, _subject to change based on AVAX's price_).
* **Rewards**: 147,945,205 COQ per node (claimable after the staking period ends)
