# ðŸ’¸ Yield - APY

Minipools offer a simplified and profitable approach to participating in network validation. This page details the types of yields generated by Minipools and the benefits of operating a Minipool compared to running a standard validator on the Avalanche network.

### Yields for Minipool Operators

Minipools enhance yield opportunities through the following ways:

1. **Native Validator Yield**: As each minipool is a validator on the Avalanche network, minipool operators earn yields from the validating network, similar to standard validators.
2. **GGP Staking Reward**: Minipool operators benefit from `GGP` rewards, which are based on the inflationary supply of `GGP` tokens. Rewards are calculated from the total effective `GGP` staked, up to 150% of the minipool operator's `AVAX` contribution, enhancing yield potentials.
3. **Subnet Incentives**: Additionally, Minipools may attract incentives from subnets that require decentralized and reliable validation services, adding another layer of earnings.

> The APY calculations for Minipools do not include hardware costs, which can vary based on the node operatorâ€™s geographical location and setup.

#### GGP Reward Calculation

Rewards are calculated proportionally based on your staked `GGP` up to a maximum of 150% of your `AVAX` contribution's value. Staking beyond 150% will not increase your eligible rewards. The amount of `GGP` reward is determined based on its share of the total effective GGP staked within the cycle.

#### Detailed Example

For a Minipool with a total of 2000 `AVAX` (a combination of 1000 `AVAX` from the minipool operator and 1000 `AVAX` from the liquid staking pool):

* You must stake at least 100 `AVAX` worth of `GGP`.
* The GGP reward will be increased up to 1500 `AVAX` worth of `GGP`. Beyond that, your `GGP` reward will not be increased.
