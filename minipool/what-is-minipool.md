# ðŸ’¦ What is Minipool?

A Minipool represents a validator that is jointly funded equally by `AVAX` borrowed from liquid stakers and `AVAX` contribution from the minipool operator. Thanks to Minipool design architecture, users can become validators on the Avalanche network with nearly half the usual `AVAX` requirement.

For the borrowed `AVAX`, the minipool operator needs to provide collateral in terms of `GGP`, which is the GoGoPool's protocol token, at least 10% of the amount of the borrowed `AVAX`. In return, GoGoPool distributes `GGP` rewards to the minipool operators based on their staked `GGP` as insurance, up to a maximum of 150% of the borrowed `AVAX`'s value.

#### Benefits

* **Lower Entry Costs**: Minipools lower the financial barriers to becoming a validator, requiring significantly less `AVAX` and simplifying the process with tools like the One-Click launcher.
* **Simplified Validator Launch Options**: Minipools support a One-Click Launcher for users with no coding experience, making it possible to launch a validator effortlessly. For advanced users seeking more control, a Manual Launcher is available, allowing them to customize and run their own nodes.
* **Enhanced Yield Opportunities**: Minipool operators not only earn from native validator yields and GGP staking rewards but also receive additional incentives from subnet projects for validating their subnets alongside the Avalanche mainnet.
* **Validator Networking and Incentives**: Minipools not only simplify the process for subnets to efficiently find numerous validators via GoGoPoolâ€™s marketplace but also enhance the appeal of validators to subnet projects, which offer additional incentives for their participation. This two-way benefit streamlines operations and fosters a robust support system for both validators and subnets.
* **Increased Decentralization and Security**: By enabling more participants to become validators, minipools enhance the decentralization and security of the Avalanche network, contributing to its overall resilience and integrity.
