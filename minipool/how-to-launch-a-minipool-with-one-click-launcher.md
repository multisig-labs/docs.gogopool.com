# ðŸª„ Guide: How to Launch a Minipool with One-Click Launcher

In our one-click launch experience, you only need `AVAX` to launch your minipool. We have partnered with the [ooNodz.network](https://oonodz.network/) to instantly spin up an Avalance validator node when you launch your Minipool.

We have handled buying and staking `GGP` on your behalf, with the option of a customizable collateralization ratio. If you want to use your existing `GGP` holdings, you can add to this collateralization ratio after your minipool is created on your [Dashboard](https://app.gogopool.com/dashboard/).

The visuals for each setup below show how to create a Minipool on Fuji Testnet. The steps are the same as on Mainnet, but the `AVAX` and `GGP` requirements are different.

Use our [faucet](https://faucet.gogopool.com) to get a test GGP and test GoGoPool on Fuji Testnet.

## Step 1: Register a Node ID with GoGoPool

Choose your country of residency and desired validation duration. Opting for a longer duration is recommended as it allows your `AVAX` to compound through successive 15-day cycles, enabling continuous operation of your Minipool without needing to re-queue.

You can adjust your `GGP` stake amount by clicking the **Customize GGP Stake** button.

## **Step 2: Review Details**

Once you have filled out the form, your Minipool's details will be displayed. Review the information carefully and agree to ooNodzâ€™s terms and conditions before clicking the **Create My Minipool** button.

## **Step 3: Minipool Creation**

Once you confirm the transaction to transfer `AVAX`, your Minipool will be created!

If there is no queue and sufficient `AVAX` is available in the liquid staking pool, your Minipool will be launched immediately. To view the current `AVAX` balance in the liquid staking pool and the available minipool amount to launch, please [visit our liquidity dashboard](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/GoGoPool/ggp-protocol-stats-PitGzK?tabIndex=2).

From here, view your node on the ooNodz site, visit your minipool dashboard, or book a time to talk to our founder.
