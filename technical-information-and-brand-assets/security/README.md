# ðŸ”’ Security

Security is at the core of GoGoPoolâ€™s operations. Our commitment to safeguarding our platform and users is evidenced by the strict security measures and processes we have in place:

* **Audited and Verified**: We've undergone comprehensive security audits by reputable firms, including QuantStamp, Code4Arena, Zellic, and Kudelski Security, to ensure the integrity of our protocol and to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
* **Proactive Protection**: Our active bug-bounty program encourages white-hat hackers and security researchers to help us maintain the highest security standards by identifying and reporting any potential threats.
* **Trusted by Leaders**: Recognition from leading blockchain entities like SwissBorg, who chose GoGoPool as an exclusive service provider, validates our security-first approach and the trustworthiness of our services.
