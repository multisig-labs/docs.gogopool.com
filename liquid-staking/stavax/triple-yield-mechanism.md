# Triple Yield Mechanism

The APY (Annual Percentage Yield) for `stAVAX` is a result of **three distinct yield sources combined**. This multi-layered approach is designed to create a highly competitive and sustainable yield for `stAVAX` holders.&#x20;

### 1. Avalanche Staking Rewards

This is the primary yield source. All AVAX deposited into the vault is put to work validating the Avalanche network

### 2. MEV Rewards

MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) is additional profit captured from the ordering of transactions within a block. Hypha is committed to an ethical approach, focusing exclusively on beneficial MEV strategies like arbitrage. This helps to balance prices across different platforms without negatively impacting user trades.&#x20;

The profits captured are then added to the staking rewards, increasing the overall yield for all `stAVAX` holders.

### 3. pstAVAX Yield Donations

The Hypha ecosystem includes another token, `pstAVAX`, where users deposit `AVAX` but agree to forgo their staking yield in exchange for other rewards. Instead of going to the `pstAVAX` holder, this yield is periodically collected and donated directly into the `stAVAX` vault. This regular donation of yield acts as a rewards boost, increasing the overall APY for everyone holding stAVAX

## **Reward Collection and Distribution**

The rewards from both native staking and MEV are collected together over a **15-day cycle**. These combined rewards are then streamed out linearly and deposited into the `stAVAX` vault over the following **14-day period**.
