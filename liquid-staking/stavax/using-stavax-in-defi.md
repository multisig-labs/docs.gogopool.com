# Using stAVAX in DeFi

The primary advantage of `stAVAX` is its liquidity. Unlike traditionally staked AVAX, which is locked and illiquid, `stAVAX` is a standard token that can be freely used across Avalanche's vibrant DeFi ecosystem to **earn additional yield or rewards**.

Here are the primary ways you can use your `stAVAX`:

### **Money Markets (Lending & Borrowing)**

You can supply your `stAVAX` to money markets to use it as collateral for borrowing other assets, or you can lend it out to earn additional interest. This is a popular strategy for improving capital efficiency and can enable advanced strategies like _looping_ your stake.

### **Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)**

You can become a Liquidity Provider (LP) by depositing your `stAVAX` into a liquidity pool, usually paired with AVAX (`stAVAX-AVAX`). By doing this, you help facilitate trades for other users and earn a percentage of the trading fees generated by the pool.

### **Yield Aggregators**

These platforms offer **set and forget** strategies. You can deposit `stAVAX` into a vault that automatically manages and compounds your earnings from activities like liquidity providing, saving you time and transaction fees.

### **Restaking Protocols**

Restaking allows you to use your yield-bearing `stAVAX` to help provide economic security for other protocols. In exchange for taking on this additional role, you can earn extra rewards from the protocol you are helping to secure.
