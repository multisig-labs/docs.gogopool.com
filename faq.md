# FAQ

## What is Hypha?

Hypha is the next evolution of GoGoPool, with an expansion of the protocol to better serve our mission of creating an ecosystem of L1s. Hypha adds validators sales, staking, and validation services.

## What happens to my $GGP?

Your $GGP tokens remain unchanged and continues to be a core component of our ecosystem. We're committed to expanding utility and functionality for $GGP token holders.

## Is Hypha a new token?

Hypha's point program incentivizes $GGP stake, and will eventually govern the ecosystem of L1s created through the Hypha L1 Launchpad.

## Will my Minipool still work?

Yes, your Minipool will continue functioning exactly as before with no interruption to services or rewards. Stay tuned for more protocol updates.

## Do I need to do anything as a minipool owner?

No action is required—your minipool will continue operating as usual without any changes to the system.&#x20;

## What happens to $ggAVAX?

$ggAVAX will continue to be the highest-yielding LST on Avalanche with no immediate changes.

## Do I still stake at GoGoPool?

Yes, $AVAX staking will continue under the GoGoPool brand with the same trusted process and interface you're familiar with. Stay tuned for updates.

## How do I stake $AVAX? Anything changing there?

The $AVAX staking process remains completely unchanged—the GoGoPool platform will continue to serve as an $AVAX staking hub just as before.

## Why the change from GoGoPool to Hypha?

GoGoPool has established itself as a trusted platform for AVAX staking on C-chain. With Hypha, we're expanding to embrace the rapidly growing Avalanche L1 ecosystem. This distinct focus on L1 services, including validator sales, validation, and community building, called for dedicated branding that reflects the unique opportunities in this dynamic space.
