# 🔐 Code4rena Audit

## Overview

### About C4

[Code4rena (C4)](https://code4rena.com/) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 audit contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the audit contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the GoGoPool smart contract system written in Solidity. The audit contest took place between December 15—January 3 2023.

Following the C4 audit contest, 3 wardens ([hansfriese](https://twitter.com/hansfriese), RaymondFam, and [ladboy233](https://twitter.com/Xc1008Cu)) reviewed the mitigations for all identified issues; the mitigation review report is appended below the audit contest report.

### [\[H-01\] AVAX Assigned High Water is updated incorrectly](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool-findings/issues/566)

[contracts/contract/MinipoolManager.sol#L374](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/MinipoolManager.sol#L374)

Node operators can manipulate the assigned high water to be higher than the actual.

#### Proof of Concept

The protocol rewards node operators according to the `AVAXAssignedHighWater` that is the maximum amount assigned to the specific staker during the reward cycle.

In the function `MinipoolManager.recordStakingStart()`, the `AVAXAssignedHighWater` is updated as below.

```solidity
MinipoolManager.sol
349: 	function recordStakingStart(
350: 		address nodeID,
351: 		bytes32 txID,
352: 		uint256 startTime
353: 	) external {
354: 		int256 minipoolIndex = onlyValidMultisig(nodeID);
355: 		requireValidStateTransition(minipoolIndex, MinipoolStatus.Staking);
356: 		if (startTime > block.timestamp) {
357: 			revert InvalidStartTime();
358: 		}
359:
360: 		setUint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("minipool.item", minipoolIndex, ".status")), uint256(MinipoolStatus.Staking));
361: 		setBytes32(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("minipool.item", minipoolIndex, ".txID")), txID);
362: 		setUint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("minipool.item", minipoolIndex, ".startTime")), startTime);
363:
364: 		// If this is the first of many cycles, set the initialStartTime
365: 		uint256 initialStartTime = getUint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("minipool.item", minipoolIndex, ".initialStartTime")));
366: 		if (initialStartTime == 0) {
367: 			setUint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("minipool.item", minipoolIndex, ".initialStartTime")), startTime);
368: 		}
369:
370: 		address owner = getAddress(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("minipool.item", minipoolIndex, ".owner")));
371: 		uint256 avaxLiquidStakerAmt = getUint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("minipool.item", minipoolIndex, ".avaxLiquidStakerAmt")));
372: 		Staking staking = Staking(getContractAddress("Staking"));
373: 		if (staking.getAVAXAssignedHighWater(owner) < staking.getAVAXAssigned(owner)) {
374: 			staking.increaseAVAXAssignedHighWater(owner, avaxLiquidStakerAmt);//@audit wrong
375: 		}
376:
377: 		emit MinipoolStatusChanged(nodeID, MinipoolStatus.Staking);
378: 	}
```

In the line #373, if the current assigned AVAX is greater than the owner's `AVAXAssignedHighWater`, it is increased by `avaxLiquidStakerAmt`. But this is supposed to be updated to `staking.getAVAXAssigned(owner)` rather than being increased by the amount.

Example: The node operator creates a minipool with 1000AVAX via `createMinipool(nodeID, 2 weeks, delegationFee, 1000*1e18)`.\
On creation, the assigned AVAX for the operator will be 1000AVAX.\
If the Rialtor calls `recordStakingStart()`, `AVAXAssignedHighWater` will be updated to 1000AVAX. After the validation finishes, the operator creates another minipool with 1500AVAX this time. Then on `recordStakingStart()`, `AVAXAssignedHighWater` will be updated to 2500AVAX by increasing 1500AVAX because the current assigned AVAX is 1500AVAX which is higher than the current `AVAXAssignedHighWater=1000AVAX`.\
This is wrong because the actual highest assigned amount is 1500AVAX.\
Note that `AVAXAssignedHighWater` is reset only through the function `calculateAndDistributeRewards` which can be called after `RewardsCycleSeconds=28 days`.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Call `staking.resetAVAXAssignedHighWater(owner)` instead of calling `increaseAVAXAssignedHighWater()`.

```solidity
MinipoolManager.sol
373: 		if (staking.getAVAXAssignedHighWater(owner) < staking.getAVAXAssigned(owner)) {
374: 			staking.resetAVAXAssignedHighWater(owner); //@audit update to the current AVAX assigned
375: 		}
```

### [\[H-02\] ProtocolDAO lacks a method to take out GGP](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool-findings/issues/532)

ProtocolDAO implementation does not have a method to take out GGP. So it can't handle ggp unless it updates ProtocolDAO.

#### Proof of Concept

recordStakingEnd() will pass the rewards of this reward.\
"If the validator is failing at their duties, their GGP will be slashed and used to compensate the loss to our Liquid Stakers"

At this point slashGGP() will be executed and the GGP will be transferred to "ProtocolDAO"

staking.slashGGP():

```solidity
    function slashGGP(address stakerAddr, uint256 ggpAmt) public onlySpecificRegisteredContract("MinipoolManager", msg.sender) {
        Vault vault = Vault(getContractAddress("Vault"));
        decreaseGGPStake(stakerAddr, ggpAmt);
        vault.transferToken("ProtocolDAO", ggp, ggpAmt);
    }
```

But the current ProtocolDAO implementation does not have a method to take out GGP. So it can't handle ggp unless it updates ProtocolDAO

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

1.transfer GGP to ClaimProtocolDAO\
or\
2.Similar to ClaimProtocolDAO, add spend method to retrieve GGP

```solidity
contract ProtocolDAO is Base {
...

+    function spend(
+        address recipientAddress,
+        uint256 amount
+    ) external onlyGuardian {
+        Vault vault = Vault(getContractAddress("Vault"));
+        TokenGGP ggpToken = TokenGGP(getContractAddress("TokenGGP"));
+
+        if (amount == 0 || amount > vault.balanceOfToken("ProtocolDAO", ggpToken)) {
+            revert InvalidAmount();
+        }
+
+        vault.withdrawToken(recipientAddress, ggpToken, amount);
+
+        emit GGPTokensSentByDAOProtocol(address(this), recipientAddress, amount);
+   }
```

### [\[H-03\] Node operator is getting slashed for full duration even though rewards are distributed based on a 14 day cycle](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool-findings/issues/493)

[contracts/contract/MinipoolManager.sol#L673-L675](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/main/contracts/contract/MinipoolManager.sol#L673-L675)

A node operator sends in the amount of duration they want to stake for. Behind the scenes Rialto will stake in 14 day cycles and then distribute rewards.

If a node operator doesn't have high enough availability and doesn't get any rewards, the protocol will slash their staked `GGP`. For calculating the expected rewards that are missed however, the full duration is used:

```javascript
File: MinipoolManager.sol

557:	function getExpectedAVAXRewardsAmt(uint256 duration, uint256 avaxAmt) public view returns (uint256) {
558:		ProtocolDAO dao = ProtocolDAO(getContractAddress("ProtocolDAO"));
559:		uint256 rate = dao.getExpectedAVAXRewardsRate();
560:		return (avaxAmt.mulWadDown(rate) * duration) / 365 days; // full duration used when calculating expected reward
561:	}

...

670:	function slash(int256 index) private {

...

673:		uint256 duration = getUint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("minipool.item", index, ".duration")));
674:		uint256 avaxLiquidStakerAmt = getUint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("minipool.item", index, ".avaxLiquidStakerAmt")));
675:		uint256 expectedAVAXRewardsAmt = getExpectedAVAXRewardsAmt(duration, avaxLiquidStakerAmt); // full duration
676:		uint256 slashGGPAmt = calculateGGPSlashAmt(expectedAVAXRewardsAmt);
```

This is unfair to the node operator because the expected rewards is from a 14 day cycle.

Also, If they were to be unavailable again, in a later cycle, they would get slashed for the full duration once again.

#### Impact

A node operator staking for a long time is getting slashed for an unfairly large amount if they aren't available during a 14 day period.

The protocol also wants node operators to stake in longer periods: [https://multisiglabs.notion.site/Known-Issues-42e2f733daf24893a93ad31100f4cd98](https://multisiglabs.notion.site/Known-Issues-42e2f733daf24893a93ad31100f4cd98)

> Team Comment:\
>
>
> * This can only be taken advantage of when signing up for 2-4 week validation periods. **Our protocol is incentivizing nodes to sign up for 3-12 month validation periods.** If the team notices this mechanic being abused, Rialto may update its GGP reward calculation to disincentive this behavior.

This slashing amount calculation incentives the node operator to sign up for the shortest period possible and restake themselves to minimize possible losses.

#### Proof of Concept

Test in `MinipoolManager.t.sol`:

```javascript
	function testRecordStakingEndWithSlashHighDuration() public {
		uint256 duration = 365 days;
		uint256 depositAmt = 1000 ether;
		uint256 avaxAssignmentRequest = 1000 ether;
		uint256 validationAmt = depositAmt + avaxAssignmentRequest;
		uint128 ggpStakeAmt = 200 ether;

		vm.startPrank(nodeOp);
		ggp.approve(address(staking), MAX_AMT);
		staking.stakeGGP(ggpStakeAmt);
		MinipoolManager.Minipool memory mp1 = createMinipool(depositAmt, avaxAssignmentRequest, duration);
		vm.stopPrank();

		address liqStaker1 = getActorWithTokens("liqStaker1", MAX_AMT, MAX_AMT);
		vm.prank(liqStaker1);
		ggAVAX.depositAVAX{value: MAX_AMT}();

		vm.prank(address(rialto));
		minipoolMgr.claimAndInitiateStaking(mp1.nodeID);

		bytes32 txID = keccak256("txid");
		vm.prank(address(rialto));
		minipoolMgr.recordStakingStart(mp1.nodeID, txID, block.timestamp);

		skip(2 weeks); // a two week cycle

		vm.prank(address(rialto));
		minipoolMgr.recordStakingEnd{value: validationAmt}(mp1.nodeID, block.timestamp, 0 ether);

		assertEq(vault.balanceOf("MinipoolManager"), depositAmt);

		int256 minipoolIndex = minipoolMgr.getIndexOf(mp1.nodeID);
		MinipoolManager.Minipool memory mp1Updated = minipoolMgr.getMinipool(minipoolIndex);
		assertEq(mp1Updated.status, uint256(MinipoolStatus.Withdrawable));
		assertEq(mp1Updated.avaxTotalRewardAmt, 0);
		assertTrue(mp1Updated.endTime != 0);

		assertEq(mp1Updated.avaxNodeOpRewardAmt, 0);
		assertEq(mp1Updated.avaxLiquidStakerRewardAmt, 0);

		assertEq(minipoolMgr.getTotalAVAXLiquidStakerAmt(), 0);

		assertEq(staking.getAVAXAssigned(mp1Updated.owner), 0);
		assertEq(staking.getMinipoolCount(mp1Updated.owner), 0);

		// log slash amount
		console.log("slashedAmount",mp1Updated.ggpSlashAmt);
	}
```

Slashed amount for a `365 days` duration is `100 eth` (10%). However, where they to stake for the minimum time, `14 days` the slashed amount would be only \~`3.8 eth`.

#### Tools Used

vs code, forge

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Either hard code the duration to 14 days for calculating expected rewards or calculate the actual duration using `startTime` and `endTime`.

A malicious actor can hijack a minipool of any node operator that finished the validation period or had an error.

The impacts:

1. Node operators staked funds will be lost (Loss of funds)
2. Hacker can hijack the minipool and retrieve rewards without hosting a node. (Theft of yield)

2.1 See scenario #2 comment for dependencies

#### Proof of Concept

**Background description**

The protocol created a state machine that validates transitions between minipool states. For this exploit it is important to understand three states:

1. `Prelaunch` - This state is the initial state when a minipool is created. The created minipool will have a status of `Prelaunch` until liquid stakers funds are matched and `rialto` stakes 2000 AVAX into Avalanche.
2. `Withdrawable` - This state is set when the 14 days validation period is over. In this state:\
   2.1. `rialto` returned 1000 AVAX to the liquid stakers and handled reward distribution.\
   2.2. Node operators can withdraw their staked funds and rewards.\
   2.3. If the node operator signed up for a duration longer than 14 days `rialto` will recreate the minipool and stake it for another 14 days.\

3. `Error` - This state is set when `rialto` has an issue to stake the funds in Avalanche

The state machine allows transitions according the `requireValidStateTransition` function: [https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/MinipoolManager.sol#L164](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/MinipoolManager.sol#L164)

```
    function requireValidStateTransition(int256 minipoolIndex, MinipoolStatus to) private view {
------
        } else if (currentStatus == MinipoolStatus.Withdrawable || currentStatus == MinipoolStatus.Error) {
		isValid = (to == MinipoolStatus.Finished || to == MinipoolStatus.Prelaunch);
	} else if (currentStatus == MinipoolStatus.Finished || currentStatus == MinipoolStatus.Canceled) {
		// Once a node is finished/canceled, if they re-validate they go back to beginning state
		isValid = (to == MinipoolStatus.Prelaunch);
------
```

In the above restrictions, we can see that the following transitions are allowed:

1. From `Withdrawable` state to `Prelaunch` state. This transition enables `rialto` to call `recreateMinipool`
2. From `Finished` state to `Prelaunch` state. This transition allows a node operator to re-use their nodeID to stake again in the protocol.
3. From `Error` state to `Prelaunch` state. This transition allows a node operator to re-use their nodeID to stake again in the protocol after an error.

\#2 is a needed capability, therefore `createMinipool` allows overriding a minipool record if: `nodeID` already exists and transition to `Prelaunch` is permitted

`createMinipool`:\
[https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/MinipoolManager.sol#L242](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/MinipoolManager.sol#L242)

```
	function createMinipool(
		address nodeID,
		uint256 duration,
		uint256 delegationFee,
		uint256 avaxAssignmentRequest
	) external payable whenNotPaused {
---------
		// Create or update a minipool record for nodeID
		// If nodeID exists, only allow overwriting if node is finished or canceled
		// 		(completed its validation period and all rewards paid and processing is complete)
		int256 minipoolIndex = getIndexOf(nodeID);
		if (minipoolIndex != -1) {
			requireValidStateTransition(minipoolIndex, MinipoolStatus.Prelaunch);
			resetMinipoolData(minipoolIndex);
----------
		setUint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("minipool.item", minipoolIndex, ".status")), uint256(MinipoolStatus.Prelaunch));
----------
		setAddress(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("minipool.item", minipoolIndex, ".owner")), msg.sender);
----------
	}

```

THE BUG: `createMinipool` can be called by **Anyone** with the `nodeID` of any node operator.

If `createMinipool` is called at the `Withdrawable` state or `Error` state:

* The transaction will be allowed
* The owner of the minipool will be switched to the caller.

Therefore, the minipool is hijacked and the node operator will not be able to withdraw their funds.

**Exploit scenarios**

As shown above, an attacker can **always** hijack the minipool and lock the node operators funds.

1. Cancel the minipool
2. Earn rewards on behalf of original NodeOp

_**Scenario #1 - Cancel the minipool**_

A hacker can hijack the minipool and immediately cancel the pool after a 14 day period is finished or an error state. Results:

1. Node operator will lose all his staked AVAX\
   1.1. This can be done by a malicious actor to **ALL** GoGoPool stakers to lose their funds in a period of 14 days.\

2. Hacker will not lose anything and not gain anything.

Consider the following steps:

1. Hacker creates a node and creates a minipool `node-1337`.
2. NodeOp registers a nodeID `node-123` and finished the 14 days stake period. State is `Withdrawable`.
3. Hacker calls `createMinipool` with `node-123` and deposits 1000 AVAX. Hacker is now owner of the minipool
4. Hacker calls `cancelMinipool` of `node-123` and receives his staked 1000 AVAX.
5. NodeOp cannot withdraw his staked AVAX as NodeOp is no longer the owner.
6. Hacker can withdraw staked AVAX for both `node-1337` and `node-123`

The above step #1 is **not** necessary but allow the hacker to immediately cancel the minipool without waiting 5 days.\
(See other submitted bug #211: "Anti griefing mechanism can be bypassed")

_**Scenario #2 - Use node of node operator**_

In this scenario the NodeOp registers for a duration longer then 14 days. The hacker will hijack the minipool after 14 days and earn rewards on behalf of the node operators node for the rest of the duration.\
As the NodeOp registers for a longer period of time, it is likely he will not notice he is not the owner of the minipool and continue to use his node to validate Avalanche.

Results:

1. Node operator will lose all his staked AVAX
2. Hacker will gain rewards for staking without hosting a node

Important to note:

* This scenario is only possible if `recordStakingEnd` and `recreateMinipool` are **not** called in the same transaction by `rialto`.
* During the research the sponsor has elaborated that they plan to perform the calls in the same transaction.
* The sponsor requested to submit issues related to `recordStakingEnd` and `recreateMinipool` single/multi transactions for information and clarity anyway.

Consider the following steps:

1. Hacker creates a node and creates a minipool `node-1337`.
2. NodeOp registers a nodeID `node-123` for 28 days duration and finished the 14 days stake period. State is `Withdrawable`.
3. Hacker calls `createMinipool` with `node-1234` and deposits 1000 AVAX. Hacker is now owner of minipool
4. Rialto calls `recreateMinipool` to restake the minipool in Avalanche. (This time: the owner is the hacker, the hardware is NodeOp)
5. 14 days have passed, hacker can withdraw the rewards and 1000 staked AVAX
6. NodeOps cannot withdraw staked AVAX.

#### Tools Used

VS Code, Foundry

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Fortunately, the fix is very simple.\
The reason `createMinipool` is called with an existing `nodeID` is to re-use the `nodeID` again with the protocol. GoGoPool can validate that the owner is the same address as the calling address. GoGoPool have already implemented a function that does this: `onlyOwner(index)`.

Consider placing `onlyOwner(index)` in the following area:\
[https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/MinipoolManager.sol#L243](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/MinipoolManager.sol#L243)

```
	function createMinipool(
		address nodeID,
		uint256 duration,
		uint256 delegationFee,
		uint256 avaxAssignmentRequest
	) external payable whenNotPaused {
----------
		int256 minipoolIndex = getIndexOf(nodeID);
		if (minipoolIndex != -1) {
                        onlyOwner(minipoolIndex); // AUDIT: ADDED HERE
----------
		} else {
----------
	}
```

Inflation of `ggAVAX` share price can be done by depositing as soon as the vault is created.

Impact:

1. Early depositor will be able steal other depositors funds
2. Exchange rate is inflated. As a result depositors are not able to deposit small funds.

#### Proof of Concept

If `ggAVAX` is not seeded as soon as it is created, a malicious depositor can deposit 1 WEI of AVAX to receive 1 share.\
The depositor can donate WAVAX to the vault and call `syncRewards`. This will start inflating the price.

When the attacker front-runs the creation of the vault, the attacker:

1. Calls `depositAVAX` to receive 1 share
2. Transfers `WAVAX` to `ggAVAX`
3. Calls `syncRewards` to inflate exchange rate

The issue exists because the exchange rate is calculated as the ratio between the `totalSupply` of shares and the `totalAssets()`.\
When the attacker transfers `WAVAX` and calls `syncRewards()`, the `totalAssets()` increases gradually and therefore the exchange rate also increases.

`convertToShares` : [https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/tokens/upgradeable/ERC4626Upgradeable.sol#L123](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/tokens/upgradeable/ERC4626Upgradeable.sol#L123)

```
	function convertToShares(uint256 assets) public view virtual returns (uint256) {
		uint256 supply = totalSupply; // Saves an extra SLOAD if totalSupply is non-zero.

		return supply == 0 ? assets : assets.mulDivDown(supply, totalAssets());
	}
```

Its important to note that while it is true that cycle length is 14 days, in practice time between cycles can very between 0-14 days. This is because syncRewards validates that the next reward cycle is evenly divided by the length (14 days).

`syncRewards`: [https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/tokens/TokenggAVAX.sol#L102](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/tokens/TokenggAVAX.sol#L102)

```
	function syncRewards() public {
----------
		// Ensure nextRewardsCycleEnd will be evenly divisible by `rewardsCycleLength`.
		uint32 nextRewardsCycleEnd = ((timestamp + rewardsCycleLength) / rewardsCycleLength) * rewardsCycleLength;
---------
	}
```

Therefore:

* The closer the call to `syncRewards` is to the next evenly divisible value of `rewardsCycleLength`, the closer the next `rewardsCycleEnd` will be.
* The closer the delta between `syncRewards` calls is, the higher revenue the attacker will get.

Edge case example:\
`syncRewards` is called with the timestamp 1672876799, `syncRewards` will be able to be called again 1 second later. `(1672876799 + 14 days) / 14 days) * 14 days) = 1672876800`

Additionally, the price inflation causes a revert for users who want to deposit less then the donation (WAVAX transfer) amount, due to precision rounding when depositing.

`depositAVAX`: [https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/tokens/TokenggAVAX.sol#L166](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/tokens/TokenggAVAX.sol#L166)

```
	function depositAVAX() public payable returns (uint256 shares) {
------
		if ((shares = previewDeposit(assets)) == 0) {
			revert ZeroShares();
		}
------
	}
```

**Foundry POC**

The POC will demonstrate the below scenario:

1. Bob front-runs the vault creation.
2. Bob deposits 1 WEI of AVAX to the vault.
3. Bob transfers 1000 WAVAX to the vault.
4. Bob calls `syncRewards` when block.timestamp = `1672876799`.
5. Bob waits 1 second.
6. Bob calls `syncRewards` again. Share price fully inflated.
7. Alice deposits 2000 AVAX to vault.
8. Bob withdraws 1500 AVAX (steals 500 AVAX from Alice).
9. Alice share earns her 1500 AVAX (although she deposited 2000).

Additionally, the POC will show that depositors trying to deposit less then the donation amount will revert.

Add the following test to `TokenggAVAX.t.sol`: [https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/test/unit/TokenggAVAX.t.sol#L108](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/test/unit/TokenggAVAX.t.sol#L108)

```
	function testShareInflation() public {
		uint256 depositAmount = 1;
		uint256 aliceDeposit = 2000 ether;
		uint256 donationAmount = 1000 ether;
		vm.deal(bob, donationAmount  + depositAmount);
		vm.deal(alice, aliceDeposit);

		ggAVAXImpl = new TokenggAVAX();
		ggAVAX = TokenggAVAX(deployProxy(address(ggAVAXImpl), address(guardian)));
		ggAVAX.initialize(store, ERC20(address(wavax)));

		// Bob deposits 1 WEI of AVAX
		vm.prank(bob);
		ggAVAX.depositAVAX{value: depositAmount}();
		// Bob transfers 1000 AVAX to vault
		vm.startPrank(bob);
		wavax.deposit{value: donationAmount}();
		wavax.transfer(address(ggAVAX), donationAmount);
		vm.stopPrank();
		// Bob Syncs rewards
		ggAVAX.syncRewards();

		// 1 second has passed
		// This can range between 0-14 days. Every seconds, exchange rate rises
		skip(1 seconds);

		// Alice deposits 2000 AVAX
		vm.prank(alice);
		ggAVAX.depositAVAX{value: aliceDeposit}();

		//Expectet revert when any depositor deposits less then 1000 AVAX
		vm.expectRevert(bytes4(keccak256("ZeroShares()")));
		ggAVAX.depositAVAX{value: 10 ether}();

		// Bob withdraws maximum assests for his share
		uint256 maxWithdrawAssets = ggAVAX.maxWithdraw(bob);
		vm.prank(bob);
		ggAVAX.withdrawAVAX(maxWithdrawAssets);

		//Validate bob has withdrawn 1500 AVAX
		assertEq(bob.balance, 1500 ether);

		// Alice withdraws maximum assests for her share
		maxWithdrawAssets = ggAVAX.maxWithdraw(alice);
		ggAVAX.syncRewards(); // to update accounting
		vm.prank(alice);
		ggAVAX.withdrawAVAX(maxWithdrawAssets);

		// Validate that Alice withdraw 1500 AVAX + 1 (~500 AVAX loss)
		assertEq(alice.balance, 1500 ether + 1);
	}
```

To run the POC, execute:

```
forge test -m testShareInflation -v

#### Tools Used

VS Code, Foundry

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

When creating the vault add initial funds in order to make it harder to inflate the price. Best practice would add initial funds as part of the initialization of the contract (to prevent front-running).

### [\[H-06\] MinipoolManager: node operator can avoid being slashed](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool-findings/issues/136)

_Submitted by_ [_HollaDieWaldfee_](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool-findings/issues/136)_, also found by_ [_enckrish_](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool-findings/issues/743)_,_ [_imare_](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool-findings/issues/709)_,_ [_bin2chen_](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool-findings/issues/525)_,_ [_danyams_](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool-findings/issues/321)_,_ [_0xdeadbeef0x_](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool-findings/issues/221)_,_ [_cozzetti_](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool-findings/issues/186)_, and_ [_ladboy233_](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool-findings/issues/128)

When staking is done, a Rialto multisig calls `MinipoolManager.recordStakingEnd` ([https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/MinipoolManager.sol#L385-L440](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/MinipoolManager.sol#L385-L440)).

If the `avaxTotalRewardAmt` has the value zero, the `MinipoolManager` will slash the node operator's GGP.

The issue is that the amount to slash can be greater than the GGP balance the node operator has staked.

This will cause the call to `MinipoolManager.recordStakingEnd` to revert because an underflow is detected.

This means a node operator can create a minipool that cannot be slashed.

A node operator must provide at least 10% of `avaxAssigned` as collateral by staking GGP.

It is assumed that a node operator earns AVAX at a rate of 10% per year.

So if a Minipool is created with a duration of `> 365 days`, the 10% collateral is not sufficient to pay the expected rewards.

This causes the function call to revert.

Another cause of the revert can be that the GGP price in AVAX changes. Specifically if the GGP price falls, there needs to be slashed more GGP.

Therefore if the GGP price drops enough it can cause the call to slash to revert.

I think it is important to say that with any collateralization ratio this can happen. The price of GGP must just drop enough or one must use a long enough duration.

The exact impact of this also depends on how the Rialto multisig handles failed calls to `MinipoolManager.recordStakingEnd`.

It looks like if this happens, `MinipoolManager.recordStakingError` ([https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/MinipoolManager.sol#L484-L515](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/MinipoolManager.sol#L484-L515)) is called.

This allows the node operator to withdraw his GGP stake.

**So in summary a node operator can create a Minipool that cannot be slashed and probably remove his GGP stake when it should have been slashed.**

#### Proof of Concept

When calling `MinipoolManager.recordStakingEnd` ([https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/MinipoolManager.sol#L385-L440](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/MinipoolManager.sol#L385-L440)) and the `avaxTotalRewardAmt` parameter is zero, the node operator is slashed:

```solidity
// No rewards means validation period failed, must slash node ops GGP.
if (avaxTotalRewardAmt == 0) {
    slash(minipoolIndex);
}
```

The `MinipoolManager.slash` function ([https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/MinipoolManager.sol#L670-L683](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/MinipoolManager.sol#L670-L683)) then calculates `expectedAVAXRewardsAmt` and from this `slashGGPAmt`:

```solidity
uint256 avaxLiquidStakerAmt = getUint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("minipool.item", index, ".avaxLiquidStakerAmt")));
uint256 expectedAVAXRewardsAmt = getExpectedAVAXRewardsAmt(duration, avaxLiquidStakerAmt);
uint256 slashGGPAmt = calculateGGPSlashAmt(expectedAVAXRewardsAmt);
```

Downstream there is then a revert due to underflow because of the following line in `Staking.decreaseGGPStake` ([https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/Staking.sol#L94-L97](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/Staking.sol#L94-L97)):

```solidity
subUint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("staker.item", stakerIndex, ".ggpStaked")), amount);
```

You can add the following foundry test to `MinipoolManager.t.sol`:

```solidity
function testRecordStakingEndWithSlashFail() public {
    uint256 duration = 366 days;
    uint256 depositAmt = 1000 ether;
    uint256 avaxAssignmentRequest = 1000 ether;
    uint256 validationAmt = depositAmt + avaxAssignmentRequest;
    uint128 ggpStakeAmt = 100 ether;

    vm.startPrank(nodeOp);
    ggp.approve(address(staking), MAX_AMT);
    staking.stakeGGP(ggpStakeAmt);
    MinipoolManager.Minipool memory mp1 = createMinipool(depositAmt, avaxAssignmentRequest, duration);
    vm.stopPrank();

    address liqStaker1 = getActorWithTokens("liqStaker1", MAX_AMT, MAX_AMT);
    vm.prank(liqStaker1);
    ggAVAX.depositAVAX{value: MAX_AMT}();

    vm.prank(address(rialto));
    minipoolMgr.claimAndInitiateStaking(mp1.nodeID);

    bytes32 txID = keccak256("txid");
    vm.prank(address(rialto));
    minipoolMgr.recordStakingStart(mp1.nodeID, txID, block.timestamp);

    vm.startPrank(address(rialto));

    skip(duration);

    minipoolMgr.recordStakingEnd{value: validationAmt}(mp1.nodeID, block.timestamp, 0 ether);
}
```

See that it runs successfully with `duration = 365 days` and fails with `duration = 366 days`.

The similar issue occurs when the GGP price drops. I chose to implement the test with `duration` as the cause for the underflow because your tests use a fixed AVAX/GGP price.

#### Tools Used

VSCode, Foundry

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

You should check if the amount to be slashed is greater than the node operator's GGP balance. If this is the case, the amount to be slashed should be set to the node operator's GGP balance.

I believe this check can be implemented within the `MinipoolManager.slash` function without breaking any of the existing accounting logic.

```solidity
function slash(int256 index) private {
    address nodeID = getAddress(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("minipool.item", index, ".nodeID")));
    address owner = getAddress(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("minipool.item", index, ".owner")));
    uint256 duration = getUint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("minipool.item", index, ".duration")));
    uint256 avaxLiquidStakerAmt = getUint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("minipool.item", index, ".avaxLiquidStakerAmt")));
    uint256 expectedAVAXRewardsAmt = getExpectedAVAXRewardsAmt(duration, avaxLiquidStakerAmt);
    uint256 slashGGPAmt = calculateGGPSlashAmt(expectedAVAXRewardsAmt);
    setUint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("minipool.item", index, ".ggpSlashAmt")), slashGGPAmt);

    emit GGPSlashed(nodeID, slashGGPAmt);

    Staking staking = Staking(getContractAddress("Staking"));

    if (slashGGPAmt > staking.getGGPStake(owner)) {
        slashGGPAmt = staking.getGGPStake(owner);
    }

    staking.slashGGP(owner, slashGGPAmt);
}
```

## Medium Risk Findings (22)

### [\[M-01\] `RewardsPool.sol` : It is safe to have the `startRewardsCycle` with `WhenNotPaused` modifier](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool-findings/issues/823)

_Submitted by_ [_ak1_](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool-findings/issues/823)_, also found by_ [_sces60107_](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool-findings/issues/745)

When the contract is paused , allowing startRewardsCycle would inflate the token value which might not be safe.

Rewards should not be claimed by anyone when all other operations are paused.

I saw that the `witdrawGGP` has this `WhenNotPaused` modifier.

Inflate should not consider the paused duration.

Let's say, when the contract is paused for the duration of 2 months, then the dao, protocol, and node validator would enjoy the rewards. This is not good for a healthy protocol.

#### Proof of Concept

startRewardsCycle does not have the WhenNotPaused modifier.

```
function startRewardsCycle() external {
	if (!canStartRewardsCycle()) {
		revert UnableToStartRewardsCycle();
	}


	emit NewRewardsCycleStarted(getRewardsCycleTotalAmt());


	// Set start of new rewards cycle
	setUint(keccak256("RewardsPool.RewardsCycleStartTime"), block.timestamp);
	increaseRewardsCycleCount();
	// Mint any new tokens from GGP inflation
	// This will always 'mint' (release) new tokens if the rewards cycle length requirement is met
	// 		since inflation is on a 1 day interval and it needs at least one cycle since last calculation
	inflate();


	uint256 multisigClaimContractAllotment = getClaimingContractDistribution("ClaimMultisig");
	uint256 nopClaimContractAllotment = getClaimingContractDistribution("ClaimNodeOp");
	uint256 daoClaimContractAllotment = getClaimingContractDistribution("ClaimProtocolDAO");
	if (daoClaimContractAllotment + nopClaimContractAllotment + multisigClaimContractAllotment > getRewardsCycleTotalAmt()) {
		revert IncorrectRewardsDistribution();
	}


	TokenGGP ggp = TokenGGP(getContractAddress("TokenGGP"));
	Vault vault = Vault(getContractAddress("Vault"));


	if (daoClaimContractAllotment > 0) {
		emit ProtocolDAORewardsTransfered(daoClaimContractAllotment);
		vault.transferToken("ClaimProtocolDAO", ggp, daoClaimContractAllotment);
	}


	if (multisigClaimContractAllotment > 0) {
		emit MultisigRewardsTransfered(multisigClaimContractAllotment);
		distributeMultisigAllotment(multisigClaimContractAllotment, vault, ggp);
	}


	if (nopClaimContractAllotment > 0) {
		emit ClaimNodeOpRewardsTransfered(nopClaimContractAllotment);
		ClaimNodeOp nopClaim = ClaimNodeOp(getContractAddress("ClaimNodeOp"));
		nopClaim.setRewardsCycleTotal(nopClaimContractAllotment);
		vault.transferToken("ClaimNodeOp", ggp, nopClaimContractAllotment);
	}
}
```

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

We suggest to use `WhenNotPaused` modifier.

[Link to original code](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/main/contracts/contract/ProtocolDAO.sol#L209-L216)

```solidity
File: https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/main/contracts/contract/ProtocolDAO.sol

205	/// @notice Upgrade a contract by unregistering the existing address, and registring a new address and name
	/// @param newAddr Address of the new contract
	/// @param newName Name of the new contract
	/// @param existingAddr Address of the existing contract to be deleted
209	function upgradeExistingContract(
			address newAddr,
			string memory newName,
			address existingAddr
		) external onlyGuardian {
			registerContract(newAddr, newName);
			unregisterContract(existingAddr);
216	}
```

Function `ProtocolDAO.upgradeExistingContract` handles contract upgrading. However, there are multiple implicaitons of the coding logic in the function, which render the contract upgrading impractical.

**Implication 1**:

The above function `upgradeExistingContract` registers the upgraded contract first, then unregisters the existing contract. This leads to the requirement that the upgraded contract name **must be different from** the existing contract name. Otherwise the updated contract address returned by `Storage.getAddress(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("contract.address", contractName)))` will be `address(0)` (please refer to the below POC Testcase 1). This is because if the upgraded contract uses the original name (i.e. the contract name is not changed), function call `unregisterContract(existingAddr)` in the `upgradeExistingContract` will override the registered contract address in `Storage` to address(0) due to the use of the same contract name.

Since using the same name after upgrading will run into trouble with current coding logic, a safeguard should be in place to make sure two names are really different. For example, put this statement in the `upgradeExistingContract` function:\
`require(newName != existingName, "Name not changed");`, where `existingName` can be obtained using:\
`string memory existingName = store.getString(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("contract.name", existingAddr)));`.

**Implication 2**:

If we really want a different name for an upgraded contract, we then get into more serious troubles: We have to upgrade other contracts that reference the upgraded contract since contract names are referenced mostly hardcoded (for security considerations). This may lead to a very complicated issue because contracts are cross-referenced.

For example, contract `ClaimNodeOp` references contracts `RewardsPool`, `ProtocolDAO` and `Staking`. At the same time, contract `ClaimNodeOp` is referenced by contracts `RewardsPool` and `Staking`. This means that:

1. If contract `ClaimNodeOp` was upgraded, which means the contract name `ClaimNodeOp` was changed;
2. This requires contracts `RewardsPool` and `Staking` to be upgraded (with new names) in order to correctly reference to newly named `ClaimNodeOp` contract;
3. This further requires those contracts that reference `RewardsPool` or `Staking` to be upgraded in order to correctly reference them;
4. and this further requires those contracts that reference the above upgraded contracts to be upgraded ...
5. This may lead to complicated code management issue and expose new vulnerabilites due to possible incomplete code adaptation.
6. This may render the contracts upgrading impractical.

I rate this issue as high severity due to the fact that:\
Contract upgradability is one of the main features of the whole system design (all other contracts are designed upgradable except for `TokenGGP`, `Storage` and `Vault` ). However, the current `upgradeExistingContract` function's coding logic requires the upgraded contract must change its name (refer to the below Testcase 1). This inturn requires to upgrade all relevant cross-referenced contracts (refer to the below Testcase 2). Thus leading to a quite serous code management issue while upgrading contracts, and renders upgrading contracts impractical.

#### Proof of Concept

**Testcase 1**:

This testcase demonstrates that current coding logic of upgrading contracts requires: **the upgraded contract must change its name**. Otherwise contract upgrading will run into issue. Put the below test case in file `ProtocolDAO.t.sol`. The test case demonstrates that `ProtocolDAO.upgradeExistingContract` does not function properly if the upgraded contract does not change the name. That is: the upgraded contract address returned by `Storage.getAddress(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("contract.address", contractName)))` will be `address(0)` if its name unchanged.

```solidity
	function testUpgradeExistingContractWithNameUnchanged() public {
		address addr = randAddress();
		string memory name = "existingName";

		address existingAddr = randAddress();
		string memory existingName = "existingName";

		vm.prank(guardian);
		dao.registerContract(existingAddr, existingName);
		assertEq(store.getBool(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("contract.exists", existingAddr))), true);
		assertEq(store.getAddress(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("contract.address", existingName))), existingAddr);
		assertEq(store.getString(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("contract.name", existingAddr))), existingName);

		vm.prank(guardian);
		//@audit upgrade contract while name unchanged
		dao.upgradeExistingContract(addr, name, existingAddr);
		assertEq(store.getBool(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("contract.exists", addr))), true);
		//@audit the registered address was deleted by function call `PtotocolDAO.unregisterContract(existingAddr)`
		assertEq(store.getAddress(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("contract.address", name))), address(0));
		assertEq(store.getString(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("contract.name", addr))), name);

               //@audit verify that the old contract has been de-registered
		assertEq(store.getBool(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("contract.exists", existingAddr))), false);
		assertEq(store.getAddress(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("contract.address", existingName))), address(0));
		assertEq(store.getString(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("contract.name", existingAddr))), "");
	}
```

**Testcase 2**:

This testcase demonstrates that current coding logic of upgrading contracts requires: **in order to upgrade a single contract, all cross-referenced contracts have to be upgraded and change their names**. Otherwise, other contracts will run into issues.\
If the upgraded contract does change its name, contract upgrading will succeed. However, other contracts' functions that reference the upgraded contract will fail due to referencing hardcoded contract name.\
The below testcase upgrades contract `ClaimNodeOp` to `ClaimNodeOpV2`. Then, contract `Staking` calls `increaseGGPRewards` which references hardcoded contract name `ClaimNodeOp` in its modifier. The call is failed.

Test steps:

1. Copy contract file `ClaimNodeOp.sol` to `ClaimNodeOpV2.sol`, and rename the contract name from `ClaimNodeOp` to `ClaimNodeOpV2` in file `ClaimNodeOpV2.sol`;
2. Put the below test file `UpgradeContractIssue.t.sol` under folder `test/unit/`;
3. Run the test.

**Note**: In order to test actual function call after upgrading contract, this testcase upgrades a real contract `ClaimNodeOp`. This is different from the above Testcase 1 which uses a random address to simulate a contract.

		//@audit revert due to contract Staking using hardcoded contract name "ClaimNodeOp" in the modifier
		staking.increaseGGPRewards(address(nodeOp1), 10 ether);
	}
}

```

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

1. Upgrading contract does not have to change contranct names especially in such a complicated system wherein contracts are cross-referenced in a hardcoded way. I would suggest not to change contract names when upgrading contracts.
2. In function `upgradeExistingContract` definition, swap fucnction call sequence between `registerContract()` and `unregisterContract()` so that contract names can keep unchanged after upgrading. That is, the modified function would be:

```solidity
File: https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/main/contracts/contract/ProtocolDAO.sol

205	/// @notice Upgrade a contract by unregistering the existing address, and registring a new address and name
	/// @param newAddr Address of the new contract
	/// @param newName Name of the new contract
	/// @param existingAddr Address of the existing contract to be deleted
209	function upgradeExistingContract(
			address newAddr,
			string memory newName,  //@audit this `newName` parameter can be removed if upgrading don't change contract name
			address existingAddr
		) external onlyGuardian {
  		unregisterContract(existingAddr);  //@audit unregister the existing contract first
		registerContract(newAddr, newName);  //@audit then register the upgraded contract
216	}
```

**POC of Mitigation**:

After the above recommended mitigation, the below Testcase verifies that after upgrading contracts, other contract's functions, which reference the hardcoded contract name, can still opetate correctly.

1. Make the above recommended mitigation in function `ProtocolDAO.upgradeExistingContract`;
2. Put the below test file `UpgradeContractImproved.t.sol` under folder `test/unit/`;
3. Run the test.

**Note**: Since we don't change the upgraded contract name, for testing purpose, we just need to create a new contract instance (so that the contract instance address is changed) to simulate the contract upgrading.

The Multisig can call `MinipoolManager.sol::recordStakingError()` if there is an error while registering the node as a validator. Also the Multisig can call [MinipoolManager.sol::finishFailedMinipoolByMultisig()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/MinipoolManager.sol#L528) in order to "finish" the NodeOp's minipool proccess.

If the Multisig accidentally/intentionally calls `recordStakingError()` then `finishFailedMinipoolByMultisig()` the NodeOp funds may be trapped in the protocol.

The `finishFailedMinipoolByMultisig()` has the next comment: _Multisig can move a minipool from the error state to the finished state after a human review of the error_ but the NodeOp should be able to withdraw his funds after a finished minipool.

#### Proof of Concept

I created a test for this situation in `MinipoolManager.t.sol`. At the end you can observe that the `withdrawMinipoolFunds()` reverts with `InvalidStateTransition` error:

1. NodeOp creates the minipool
2. Rialto calls claimAndInitiateStaking
3. Something goes wrong and Rialto calls recordStakingError()
4. Rialto accidentally/intentionally calls finishFailedMinipoolByMultisig() in order to finish the NodeOp's minipool
5. The NodeOp can not withdraw his funds. The withdraw function reverts with InvalidStateTransition() error

```solidity
function testUserFundsStuckErrorFinished() public {
    // NodeOp funds may be trapped by a invalid state transition
    // 1. NodeOp creates the minipool
    // 2. Rialto calls claimAndInitiateStaking
    // 3. Something goes wrong and Rialto calls recordStakingError()
    // 4. Rialto accidentally/intentionally calls finishFailedMinipoolByMultisig() in order
    // to finish the NodeOp's minipool
    // 5. The NodeOp can not withdraw his funds. The withdraw function reverts with
    // InvalidStateTransition() error
    //
    // 1. Create the minipool by the NodeOp
    //
    address liqStaker1 = getActorWithTokens("liqStaker1", MAX_AMT, MAX_AMT);
    vm.prank(liqStaker1);
    ggAVAX.depositAVAX{value: MAX_AMT}();
    assertEq(liqStaker1.balance, 0);
    uint256 duration = 2 weeks;
    uint256 depositAmt = 1000 ether;
    uint256 avaxAssignmentRequest = 1000 ether;
    uint256 validationAmt = depositAmt + avaxAssignmentRequest;
    uint128 ggpStakeAmt = 200 ether;
    vm.startPrank(nodeOp);
    ggp.approve(address(staking), ggpStakeAmt);
    staking.stakeGGP(ggpStakeAmt);
    MinipoolManager.Minipool memory mp = createMinipool(depositAmt, avaxAssignmentRequest, duration);
    vm.stopPrank();
    assertEq(vault.balanceOf("MinipoolManager"), depositAmt);
    //
    // 2. Rialto calls claimAndInitiateStaking
    //
    vm.startPrank(address(rialto));
    minipoolMgr.claimAndInitiateStaking(mp.nodeID);
    assertEq(vault.balanceOf("MinipoolManager"), 0);
    //
    // 3. Something goes wrong and Rialto calls recordStakingError()
    //
    bytes32 errorCode = "INVALID_NODEID";
    minipoolMgr.recordStakingError{value: validationAmt}(mp.nodeID, errorCode);
    // NodeOps funds should be back in vault
    assertEq(vault.balanceOf("MinipoolManager"), depositAmt);
    // 4. Rialto accidentally/intentionally calls finishFailedMinipoolByMultisig() in order
    // to finish the NodeOp's minipool
    minipoolMgr.finishFailedMinipoolByMultisig(mp.nodeID);
    vm.stopPrank();
    // 5. The NodeOp can not withdraw his funds. The withdraw function reverts with
    // InvalidStateTransition() error
    vm.startPrank(nodeOp);
    vm.expectRevert(MinipoolManager.InvalidStateTransition.selector);
    minipoolMgr.withdrawMinipoolFunds(mp.nodeID);
    vm.stopPrank();
}
```

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

The `withdrawMinipoolFunds` could add another [requireValidStateTransition](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/MinipoolManager.sol#LL290C3-L290C30) in order to allow the withdraw after the finished minipoool.

For every created minipool a multisig address is set to continue validator interactions.

Every minipool multisig address get assigned by calling `requireNextActiveMultisig`.

This function always return the first enabled multisig address.

In case the specific address is disabled all created minipools will be stuck with this address which increase the probability of also funds being stuck.

#### Impact

Probability of funds being stuck increases if `requireNextActiveMultisig` always return the same address.

#### Proof of Concept

[https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/MultisigManager.sol#L80-L91](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/MultisigManager.sol#L80-L91)

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Use a strategy like [round robin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin\_item\_allocation) to assign next active multisig to minipool.

Something like this :

```solidity
private uint nextMultisigAddressIdx;

function requireNextActiveMultisig() external view returns (address) {
    uint256 total = getUint(keccak256("multisig.count"));
    address addr;
    bool enabled;

    uint256 i = nextMultisigAddressIdx; // cache last used
    if (nextMultisigAddressIdx==total) {
        i = 0;
    }

    for (; i < total; i++) {
        (addr, enabled) = getMultisig(i);
        if (enabled) {
            nextMultisigAddressIdx = i+1;
            return addr;
        }
    }

    revert NoEnabledMultisigFound();
}
```

The `whenNotPaused` modifier is used to pause minipool creation and staking/withdrawing GGP. However, there are several cases this modifier could be bypassed, which breaks the intended admin control function and special mode.

#### Proof of Concept

**`stake()`**

In paused mode, no more `stakeGGP()` is allowed,

```solidity
File: contract/Staking.sol
319: 	function stakeGGP(uint256 amount) external whenNotPaused {
320: 		// Transfer GGP tokens from staker to this contract
321: 		ggp.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
322: 		_stakeGGP(msg.sender, amount);
323: 	}
```

However, `restakeGGP()` is still available, which potentially violate the purpose of pause mode.

```solidity
File: contract/Staking.sol
328: 	function restakeGGP(address stakerAddr, uint256 amount) public onlySpecificRegisteredContract("ClaimNodeOp", msg.sender) {
329: 		// Transfer GGP tokens from the ClaimNodeOp contract to this contract
330: 		ggp.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
331: 		_stakeGGP(stakerAddr, amount);
332: 	}
```

**`withdraw()`**

In paused mode, no more `withdrawGGP()` is allowed,

```solidity
File: contract/Staking.sol
358: 	function withdrawGGP(uint256 amount) external whenNotPaused {

373: 		vault.withdrawToken(msg.sender, ggp, amount);
```

However, `claimAndRestake()` is still available, which can withdraw from the vault.

```solidity
File: contract/ClaimNodeOp.sol
089: 	function claimAndRestake(uint256 claimAmt) external {

103: 		if (restakeAmt > 0) {
104: 			vault.withdrawToken(address(this), ggp, restakeAmt);
105: 			ggp.approve(address(staking), restakeAmt);
106: 			staking.restakeGGP(msg.sender, restakeAmt);
107: 		}
108:
109: 		if (claimAmt > 0) {
110: 			vault.withdrawToken(msg.sender, ggp, claimAmt);
111: 		}
```

The function `spend()` can also ignore the pause mode to withdraw from the vault. But this is a guardian function. It could be intended behavior.

```solidity
File: contract/ClaimProtocolDAO.sol
20: 	function spend(
21: 		string memory invoiceID,
22: 		address recipientAddress,
23: 		uint256 amount
24: 	) external onlyGuardian {

32: 		vault.withdrawToken(recipientAddress, ggpToken, amount);
```

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

* add the `whenNotPaused` modifier to `restakeGGP()` and `claimAndRestake()`
* maybe also for guardian function `spend()`.

_Submitted by_ [_wagmi_](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool-findings/issues/648)_, also found by_ [_peritoflores_](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool-findings/issues/811)_,_ [_sces60107_](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool-findings/issues/674)_,_ [_\_\_141345\_\__](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool-findings/issues/646)_,_ [_hansfriese_](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool-findings/issues/575)_,_ [_slowmoses_](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool-findings/issues/464)_,_ [_supernova_](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool-findings/issues/374)_,_ [_rvierdiiev_](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool-findings/issues/239)_,_ [_HollaDieWaldfee_](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool-findings/issues/157)_, and_ [_chaduke_](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool-findings/issues/92)

When doing inflation, function `getInflationAmt()` calculated number of intervals elapsed by dividing the duration with interval length.

```solidity
function getInflationIntervalsElapsed() public view returns (uint256) {
    ProtocolDAO dao = ProtocolDAO(getContractAddress("ProtocolDAO"));
    uint256 startTime = getInflationIntervalStartTime();
    if (startTime == 0) {
        revert ContractHasNotBeenInitialized();
    }
    return (block.timestamp - startTime) / dao.getInflationIntervalSeconds();
}
```

As we can noticed that, this calculation is rounding down, it means if `block.timestamp - startTime = 1.99 intervals`, it only account for `1 interval`.

However, when updating start time after inflating, it still update to current timestamp while it should only increased by `intervalLength * intervalsElapsed` instead.

```solidity
addUint(keccak256("RewardsPool.InflationIntervalStartTime"), inflationIntervalElapsedSeconds);
// @audit should only update to oldStartTime + inverval * numInterval
setUint(keccak256("RewardsPool.RewardsCycleTotalAmt"), newTokens);
```

Since default value of inflation interval = 1 days and reward cycle length = 14 days, so the impact is reduced. However, these configs can be changed in the future.

#### Proof of Concept

Consider the scenario:

1. Assume last inflation time is `InflationIntervalStartTime = 100`. `InflationIntervalSeconds = 50`.
2. At `timestamp = 199`, function `getInflationAmt()` will calculate

```solidity
inflationIntervalsElapsed = (199 - 100) / 50 = 1
// Compute inflation for total inflation intervals elapsed
for (uint256 i = 0; i < inflationIntervalsElapsed; i++) {
    newTotalSupply = newTotalSupply.mulWadDown(inflationRate);
} // @audit only loop once.
```

3. And then in `inflate()` function, `InflationIntervalStartTime` is still updated to current timestamp, so `InflationIntervalStartTime = 199`.
4. If this sequence of actions are repeatedly used, we can easily see

```solidity
InflationIntervalStartTime = 199, inflated count = 1
InflationIntervalStartTime = 298, inflated count = 2
InflationIntervalStartTime = 397, inflated count = 3
InflationIntervalStartTime = 496, inflated count = 4
InflationIntervalStartTime = 595, inflated count = 5
```

While at `timestamp = 595`, inflated times should be `(595 - 100) / 50 = 9` instead.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider only increasing `InflationIntervalStartTime` by the amount of intervals time interval length.

### [\[M-07\] Rialto may not be able to cancel minipools created by contracts that cannot receive AVAX](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool-findings/issues/623)

_Submitted by_ [_Jeiwan_](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool-findings/issues/623)_, also found by_ [_AkshaySrivastav_](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool-findings/issues/809)_,_ [_peritoflores_](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool-findings/issues/686)_, and_ [_ladboy233_](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool-findings/issues/146)

A malicious node operator may create a minipool that cannot be cancelled.

#### Proof of Concept

Rialto may cancel a minipool by calling [cancelMinipoolByMultisig](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/MinipoolManager.sol#L520), however the function sends AVAX to the minipool owner, and the owner may block receiving of AVAX, causing the call to `cancelMinipoolByMultisig` to fail ([MinipoolManager.sol#L664](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/MinipoolManager.sol#L664)):

```solidity
function _cancelMinipoolAndReturnFunds(address nodeID, int256 index) private {
  ...
  address owner = getAddress(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("minipool.item", index, ".owner")));
  ...
  owner.safeTransferETH(avaxNodeOpAmt);
}
```

The following PoC demonstrates how calls to `cancelMinipoolByMultisig` can be blocked:

```solidity
function testCancelMinipoolByMultisigDOS_AUDIT() public {
  uint256 duration = 2 weeks;
  uint256 depositAmt = 1000 ether;
  uint256 avaxAssignmentRequest = 1000 ether;
  uint128 ggpStakeAmt = 200 ether;

  // Node operator is a contract than cannot receive AVAX:
  // contract NodeOpContract {}
  NodeOpContract nodeOpContract = new NodeOpContract();
  dealGGP(address(nodeOpContract), ggpStakeAmt);
  vm.deal(address(nodeOpContract), depositAmt);

  vm.startPrank(address(nodeOpContract));
  ggp.approve(address(staking), MAX_AMT);
  staking.stakeGGP(ggpStakeAmt);
  MinipoolManager.Minipool memory mp1 = createMinipool(depositAmt, avaxAssignmentRequest, duration);
  vm.stopPrank();

  bytes32 errorCode = "INVALID_NODEID";
  int256 minipoolIndex = minipoolMgr.getIndexOf(mp1.nodeID);
  store.setUint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("minipool.item", minipoolIndex, ".status")), uint256(MinipoolStatus.Prelaunch));

  // Rialto trices to cancel the minipool created by the node operator contract but the transaction reverts since
  // the node operator contract cannot receive AVAX.
  vm.prank(address(rialto));
  // FAIL: reverted with ETH_TRANSFER_FAILED
  minipoolMgr.cancelMinipoolByMultisig(mp1.nodeID, errorCode);
}
```

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider using the [Pull over Push pattern](https://fravoll.github.io/solidity-patterns/pull\_over\_push.html) to return AVAX to owners of minipools that are canceled by Rialto.

### [\[M-08\] Recreated pools receive a wrong AVAX amount due to miscalculated compounded liquid staker amount](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool-findings/issues/620)

_Submitted by_ [_Jeiwan_](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool-findings/issues/620)_, also found by_ [_yixxas_](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool-findings/issues/501)_,_ [_Franfran_](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool-findings/issues/489)_, and_ [_0xbepresent_](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool-findings/issues/347)

After recreation, minipools will receive more AVAX than the sum of their owners' current stake and the rewards that they generated.

#### Proof of Concept

Multipools that successfully finished validation may be recreated by multisigs, before staked GGP and deposited AVAX have been withdrawn by minipool owners ([MinipoolManager.sol#L444](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/MinipoolManager.sol#L444)). The function compounds deposited AVAX by adding the rewards earned during previous validation periods to the AVAX amounts deposited and requested from stakers ([MinipoolManager.sol#L450-L452](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/MinipoolManager.sol#L450-L452)):

```solidity
Minipool memory mp = getMinipool(minipoolIndex);
// Compound the avax plus rewards
// NOTE Assumes a 1:1 nodeOp:liqStaker funds ratio
uint256 compoundedAvaxNodeOpAmt = mp.avaxNodeOpAmt + mp.avaxNodeOpRewardAmt;
setUint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("minipool.item", minipoolIndex, ".avaxNodeOpAmt")), compoundedAvaxNodeOpAmt);
setUint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("minipool.item", minipoolIndex, ".avaxLiquidStakerAmt")), compoundedAvaxNodeOpAmt);
```

The function assumes that a node operator and liquid stakers earned an equal reward amount: `compoundedAvaxNodeOpAmt` is calculated as the sum of the current AVAX deposit of the minipool owner and the node operator reward earned so far. However, liquid stakers get a smaller reward than node operators: the minipool node commission fee is applied to their share ([MinipoolManager.sol#L417](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/MinipoolManager.sol#L417)):

```solidity
  uint256 avaxHalfRewards = avaxTotalRewardAmt / 2;

  // Node operators recv an additional commission fee
  ProtocolDAO dao = ProtocolDAO(getContractAddress("ProtocolDAO"));
  uint256 avaxLiquidStakerRewardAmt = avaxHalfRewards - avaxHalfRewards.mulWadDown(dao.getMinipoolNodeCommissionFeePct());
  uint256 avaxNodeOpRewardAmt = avaxTotalRewardAmt - avaxLiquidStakerRewardAmt;
```

As a result, the `avaxLiquidStakerAmt` set in the `recreateMinipool` function will always be bigger than the actual amount since it equals to the compounded node operator amount, which includes node operator rewards.

Next, in the `recreateMinipool` function, the assigned AVAX amount is increased by the amount borrowed from liquid stakers + the node operator amount, which is again wrong because the assigned AVAX amount can only be increased by the liquid stakers' reward share ([MinipoolManager.sol#L457-L459](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/MinipoolManager.sol#L457-L459)):

```solidity
staking.increaseAVAXStake(mp.owner, mp.avaxNodeOpRewardAmt);
staking.increaseAVAXAssigned(mp.owner, compoundedAvaxNodeOpAmt);
staking.increaseMinipoolCount(mp.owner);
```

As a result, the amount of AVAX borrowed from liquid stakers by the minipool will be increased by the minipool node commission fee, the increased amount will be sent to the validator, and it will be required to end the validation period.

The following PoC demonstrates the wrong calculation:

```solidity
// test/unit/MinipoolManager.t.sol
function testRecreateMinipoolWrongLiquidStakerReward_AUDIT() public {
  uint256 duration = 4 weeks;
  uint256 depositAmt = 1000 ether;
  uint256 avaxAssignmentRequest = 1000 ether;
  uint256 validationAmt = depositAmt + avaxAssignmentRequest;
  // Enough to start but not to re-stake, we will add more later
  uint128 ggpStakeAmt = 100 ether;

  vm.startPrank(nodeOp);
  ggp.approve(address(staking), MAX_AMT);
  staking.stakeGGP(ggpStakeAmt);
  MinipoolManager.Minipool memory mp = createMinipool(depositAmt, avaxAssignmentRequest, duration);
  vm.stopPrank();

  address liqStaker1 = getActorWithTokens("liqStaker1", MAX_AMT, MAX_AMT);
  vm.prank(liqStaker1);
  ggAVAX.depositAVAX{value: MAX_AMT}();

  vm.prank(address(rialto));
  minipoolMgr.claimAndInitiateStaking(mp.nodeID);

  bytes32 txID = keccak256("txid");
  vm.prank(address(rialto));
  minipoolMgr.recordStakingStart(mp.nodeID, txID, block.timestamp);

  skip(duration / 2);

  // Give rialto the rewards it needs
  uint256 rewards = 10 ether;
  deal(address(rialto), address(rialto).balance + rewards);

  // Pay out the rewards
  vm.prank(address(rialto));
  minipoolMgr.recordStakingEnd{value: validationAmt + rewards}(mp.nodeID, block.timestamp, rewards);
  MinipoolManager.Minipool memory mpAfterEnd = minipoolMgr.getMinipoolByNodeID(mp.nodeID);
  assertEq(mpAfterEnd.avaxNodeOpAmt, depositAmt);
  assertEq(mpAfterEnd.avaxLiquidStakerAmt, avaxAssignmentRequest);

  // After the validation periods has ended, the node operator and liquid stakers got different rewards,
  // since a fee was taken from the liquid stakers' share.
  uint256 nodeOpReward = 5.75 ether;
  uint256 liquidStakerReward = 4.25 ether;
  assertEq(mpAfterEnd.avaxNodeOpRewardAmt, nodeOpReward);
  assertEq(mpAfterEnd.avaxLiquidStakerRewardAmt, liquidStakerReward);

  // Add a bit more collateral to cover the compounding rewards
  vm.prank(nodeOp);
  staking.stakeGGP(1 ether);

  vm.prank(address(rialto));
  minipoolMgr.recreateMinipool(mp.nodeID);

  MinipoolManager.Minipool memory mpCompounded = minipoolMgr.getMinipoolByNodeID(mp.nodeID);
  // After pool was recreated, node operator's amounts were increased correctly.
  assertEq(mpCompounded.avaxNodeOpAmt, mp.avaxNodeOpAmt + nodeOpReward);
  assertEq(mpCompounded.avaxNodeOpAmt, mp.avaxNodeOpInitialAmt + nodeOpReward);
  assertEq(staking.getAVAXStake(mp.owner), mp.avaxNodeOpAmt + nodeOpReward);

  // However, liquid stakers' amount were increased incorrectly: nodeOpReward was added instead of liquidStakerReward.
  // These assertions will fail:
  // expected: 1004.25 ether, actual 1005.75 ether
  assertEq(mpCompounded.avaxLiquidStakerAmt, mp.avaxLiquidStakerAmt + liquidStakerReward);
  assertEq(staking.getAVAXAssigned(mp.owner), mp.avaxLiquidStakerAmt + liquidStakerReward);
}
```

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

When compounding rewards in the `recreateMinipool` function, consider using an average reward so that node operator's and liquid stakers' deposits are increased equally and the entire reward amount is used:

                staking.increaseMinipoolCount(mp.owner);
```

Also, consider sending equal amounts of rewards to the vault and the ggAVAX token in the `recordStakingEnd` function.

This issue is related to state transition of Minipools.\
According to the implementation, the possible states and transitions are as below.

![Imgur](https://imgur.com/ASL235O.jpg)

The Rialto may call `recreateMinipool` when the minipool is in states of `Withdrawable, Finished, Error, Canceled`.\
The problem is that these four states are not the same in the sense of holding the node operator's AVAX.\
If the state flow has followed `Prelaunch->Launched->Staking->Error`, all the AVAX are still in the vault.\
If the state flow has followed `Prelaunch->Launched->Staking->Error->Finished` (last transition by `withdrawMinipoolFunds`), all the AVAX are sent back to the node operator.\
So if the Rialto calls `recreateMinipool` for the second case, there are no AVAX deposited from the node operator at that point but there can be AVAX from other mini pools in the state of Prelaunch.\
Because there are AVAX in the vault (and these are not managed per staker base), `recreatePool` results in a new mini pool in `Prelaunch` state and it is further possible to go through the normal flow `Prelaunch->Launched->Staking->Withdrawable->Finished`.\
And the other minipool that was waiting for launch will not be able to launch because the vault is lack of AVAX.

Below is a test case written to show an example.

```solidity
function testAudit() public {
  uint256 duration = 2 weeks;
  uint256 depositAmt = 1000 ether;
  uint256 avaxAssignmentRequest = 1000 ether;
  uint256 validationAmt = depositAmt + avaxAssignmentRequest;
  uint128 ggpStakeAmt = 200 ether;

  // Node Op 1
  vm.startPrank(nodeOp);
  ggp.approve(address(staking), MAX_AMT);
  staking.stakeGGP(ggpStakeAmt);
  MinipoolManager.Minipool memory mp1 = createMinipool(
    depositAmt,
    avaxAssignmentRequest,
    duration
  );
  vm.stopPrank();

  // Node Op 2
  address nodeOp2 = getActorWithTokens("nodeOp2", MAX_AMT, MAX_AMT);
  vm.startPrank(nodeOp2);
  ggp.approve(address(staking), MAX_AMT);
  staking.stakeGGP(ggpStakeAmt);
  MinipoolManager.Minipool memory mp2 = createMinipool(
    depositAmt,
    avaxAssignmentRequest,
    duration
  );
  vm.stopPrank();

  int256 minipoolIndex = minipoolMgr.getIndexOf(mp1.nodeID);

  address liqStaker1 = getActorWithTokens("liqStaker1", MAX_AMT, MAX_AMT);
  vm.prank(liqStaker1);
  ggAVAX.depositAVAX{ value: MAX_AMT }();

  // Node Op 1: Prelaunch->Launched
  vm.prank(address(rialto));
  minipoolMgr.claimAndInitiateStaking(mp1.nodeID);

  bytes32 txID = keccak256("txid");
  vm.prank(address(rialto));
  // Node Op 1: Launched->Staking
  minipoolMgr.recordStakingStart(mp1.nodeID, txID, block.timestamp);

  vm.prank(address(rialto));
  // Node Op 1: Staking->Error
  bytes32 errorCode = "INVALID_NODEID";
  minipoolMgr.recordStakingError{ value: validationAmt }(mp1.nodeID, errorCode);

  // There are 2*depositAmt AVAX in the pool manager
  assertEq(vault.balanceOf("MinipoolManager"), depositAmt * 2);

  // Node Op 1: Staking->Finished withdrawing funds
  vm.prank(nodeOp);
  minipoolMgr.withdrawMinipoolFunds(mp1.nodeID);
  assertEq(staking.getAVAXStake(nodeOp), 0);
  mp1 = minipoolMgr.getMinipool(minipoolIndex);
  assertEq(mp1.status, uint256(MinipoolStatus.Finished));

  // Rialto recreate a minipool for the mp1
  vm.prank(address(rialto));
  // Node Op 1: Finished -> Prelaunch
  minipoolMgr.recreateMinipool(mp1.nodeID);

  assertEq(vault.balanceOf("MinipoolManager"), depositAmt);

  // Node Op 1: Prelaunch -> Launched
  vm.prank(address(rialto));
  minipoolMgr.claimAndInitiateStaking(mp1.nodeID);

  // Node Op 1: Launched -> Staking
  vm.prank(address(rialto));
  minipoolMgr.recordStakingStart(mp1.nodeID, txID, block.timestamp);

  assertEq(staking.getAVAXStake(nodeOp), 0);
  assertEq(staking.getAVAXAssigned(nodeOp), depositAmt);
  assertEq(staking.getAVAXAssignedHighWater(nodeOp), depositAmt);

  // now try to launch the second operator's pool, it will fail with InsufficientContractBalance
  vm.prank(address(rialto));
  vm.expectRevert(Vault.InsufficientContractBalance.selector);
  minipoolMgr.claimAndInitiateStaking(mp2.nodeID);
}

```

#### Tools Used

Manual Review, Foundry

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Make sure to keep the node operator's deposit status the same for all states that can lead to the same state.\
For example, for all states that can transition to Prelaunch, make sure to send the AVAX back to the user and get them back on the call `recreateMiniPool()`.

### [\[M-10\] Functions `cancelMinipool()` doesn't reset the value of the `RewardsStartTime` for user when user's `minipoolcount` is zero](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool-findings/issues/555)

The value of `RewardsStartTime` shows when node runner started the minipool and validation rewards are generated by node runner. it is used to see if node runners are eligible for ggp rewards or not and node runners should run their node for minimum amount of time during the rewarding cycle to be eligible for rewards. but right now node runner can create a mimipool and cancel it (after waiting time) and even so the minipool generated no rewards and cancelled the value of `RewardsStartTime` won't get reset for node runner and in the end of the cycle node runner would be eligible for rewards (node runner can create another minipool near the end of cycle). so this issue would cause wrong reward distribution between node runners and code doesn't correctly track `RewardsStartTime` for node runners and malicious node runners can use this issue and receive rewards without running validation nodes for the minimum amount of required time.

#### Proof of Concept

This is `cancelMinipool()` and `_cancelMinipoolAndReturnFunds()` code:

```
	function cancelMinipool(address nodeID) external nonReentrant {
		Staking staking = Staking(getContractAddress("Staking"));
		ProtocolDAO dao = ProtocolDAO(getContractAddress("ProtocolDAO"));
		int256 index = requireValidMinipool(nodeID);
		onlyOwner(index);
		// make sure they meet the wait period requirement
		if (block.timestamp - staking.getRewardsStartTime(msg.sender) < dao.getMinipoolCancelMoratoriumSeconds()) {
			revert CancellationTooEarly();
		}
		_cancelMinipoolAndReturnFunds(nodeID, index);
	}

	function _cancelMinipoolAndReturnFunds(address nodeID, int256 index) private {
		requireValidStateTransition(index, MinipoolStatus.Canceled);
		setUint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("minipool.item", index, ".status")), uint256(MinipoolStatus.Canceled));

		address owner = getAddress(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("minipool.item", index, ".owner")));
		uint256 avaxNodeOpAmt = getUint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("minipool.item", index, ".avaxNodeOpAmt")));
		uint256 avaxLiquidStakerAmt = getUint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("minipool.item", index, ".avaxLiquidStakerAmt")));

		Staking staking = Staking(getContractAddress("Staking"));
		staking.decreaseAVAXStake(owner, avaxNodeOpAmt);
		staking.decreaseAVAXAssigned(owner, avaxLiquidStakerAmt);

		staking.decreaseMinipoolCount(owner);

		emit MinipoolStatusChanged(nodeID, MinipoolStatus.Canceled);

		Vault vault = Vault(getContractAddress("Vault"));
		vault.withdrawAVAX(avaxNodeOpAmt);
		owner.safeTransferETH(avaxNodeOpAmt);
	}
```

As you can see there is no check that user's minipool count is zero and if it is to reset the value of `RewardsStartTime` for user so if a user creates a minipool in the start of the cycle and then cancel it after 5 days and wait for end of the cycle and start another minipool and increase his staking AVAX he would be eligible for ggp rewards (`ClaimNodeOp.isEligible()` would return `true` for that user even so the user didn't run node for the required amount of time in the cycle). these are the steps to exploit this:

1. node runner would create a minipool near start time of the ggp rewarding cycle and the value of `RewardsStartTime` would set for node runner.
2. after 5 days that node runner's minipool has not been launched by multisig (for any reason) node runner would call `cancelMinipool()` and code would cancel his minipool but won't reset `RewardsStartTime` for node runner.
3. after 20 days and near end of the gpp reward cycle node runner would create another minipool and start running node.
4. in the end even so node runner only start running node and earning reward near end of the reward cycle but code would count node runner as eligible for rewards because `RewardsStartTime` for node runner shows wrong value.

This bug would cause rewards to be distributed wrongly between node runners and malicious node runners can bypass required time for running nodes during reward cycle to be eligible for rewards.

#### Tools Used

VIM

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Set the value of `RewardsStartTime` based on successfully finished minipools or when minipool is launched and user can't cancel minipool.

### [\[M-11\] MultisigManager may not be able to add a valid Multisig](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool-findings/issues/521)

_Submitted by_ [_bin2chen_](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool-findings/issues/521)_, also found by_ [_immeas_](../../../about-gogopool/undefined/)_,_ [_RaymondFam_](../../../about-gogopool/undefined/)_,_ [_ast3ros_](../../../about-gogopool/undefined/)_,_ [_cryptonue_](../../../about-gogopool/undefined/)_,_ [_0xhunter_](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool-findings/issues/828)_,_ [_adriro_](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool-findings/issues/765)_,_ [_0xbepresent_](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool-findings/issues/349)_, and_ [_Saintcode\__](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool-findings/issues/189)

When more than 10 mulitsig, it is impossible to modify or delete the old ones, making it impossible to create new valid ones.

#### Proof of Concept

MultisigManager limits the number of Multisig to 10, which cannot be deleted or replaced after they have been disabled.\
This will have a problem, if the subsequent use of 10, all 10 for some reason, be disabled.\
Then it is impossible to add new ones and replace the old ones, so you have to continue using the old Multisig at risk.

```solidity
    function registerMultisig(address addr) external onlyGuardian {
        int256 multisigIndex = getIndexOf(addr);
        if (multisigIndex != -1) {
            revert MultisigAlreadyRegistered();
        }
        uint256 index = getUint(keccak256("multisig.count"));
        if (index >= MULTISIG_LIMIT) {
            revert MultisigLimitReached(); //***@audit limt 10, and no other way to delete or replace the old Multisig ***//
        }
```

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add replace old mulitsig method

```solidity
    function replaceMultisig(address addr,address oldAddr) external onlyGuardian {
        int256 multisigIndex = getIndexOf(oldAddr);
        if (multisigIndex == -1) {
            revert MultisigNotFound();
        }

        setAddress(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("multisig.item", multisigIndex, ".address")), addr);
        emit RegisteredMultisig(addr, msg.sender);
    }

```

and after 5 days, the user cancels the minipool

```
	/// @notice Owner of a minipool can cancel the (prelaunch) minipool
	/// @param nodeID 20-byte Avalanche node ID the Owner registered with
	function cancelMinipool(address nodeID) external nonReentrant {
		Staking staking = Staking(getContractAddress("Staking"));
		ProtocolDAO dao = ProtocolDAO(getContractAddress("ProtocolDAO"));
		int256 index = requireValidMinipool(nodeID);
		onlyOwner(index);
		// make sure they meet the wait period requirement
		if (block.timestamp - staking.getRewardsStartTime(msg.sender) < dao.getMinipoolCancelMoratoriumSeconds()) {
			revert CancellationTooEarly();
		}
		_cancelMinipoolAndReturnFunds(nodeID, index);
	}
```

Then, the user recreates the minipool again by calling the same createMinipool function. Then, the user cancels the minipool immediately. The user should not be allowed to cancel the minpool immediately and he should wait for 5 more days.

Added a test unit to MinipoolManager.t.sol

```
	function testMinipoolManager() public {
		address nodeID1 = randAddress();

		vm.startPrank(nodeOp);
		ggp.approve(address(staking), MAX_AMT);
		staking.stakeGGP(100 ether);

		{
			MinipoolManager.Minipool memory mp = createMyMinipool(nodeID1, 1000 ether, 1000 ether, 2 weeks);

			skip(5 days);
			minipoolMgr.cancelMinipool(mp.nodeID); // Must skip 5 days to be executed
		}

		{
			MinipoolManager.Minipool memory mp = createMyMinipool(nodeID1, 1000 ether, 1000 ether, 2 weeks);
			minipoolMgr.cancelMinipool(mp.nodeID); // Do not need 5 days more to be executed which is wrong
		}

		vm.stopPrank();
	}
```

### [\[M-13\] Slashing fails when node operator doesn't have enough staked `GGP`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool-findings/issues/494)

When creating a minipool the node operator is required to put up a collateral in `GGP`, the protocol token. The amount of `GGP` collateral needed is currently calculated to be 10% of the `AVAX` staked. This is calculated using the price of `GGP - AVAX`.

If the node operator doesn't have high enough availability and doesn't get any rewards the protocol will slash their `GGP` collateral to reward liquid stakers. This is also calculated using the price of `GGP - AVAX`:

```javascript
File: MinipoolManager.sol

547:	function calculateGGPSlashAmt(uint256 avaxRewardAmt) public view returns (uint256) {
548:		Oracle oracle = Oracle(getContractAddress("Oracle"));
549:		(uint256 ggpPriceInAvax, ) = oracle.getGGPPriceInAVAX(); // price might change or be manipulated
550:		return avaxRewardAmt.divWadDown(ggpPriceInAvax);
551:	}

...

670:	function slash(int256 index) private {

...

673:		uint256 duration = getUint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("minipool.item", index, ".duration")));
674:		uint256 avaxLiquidStakerAmt = getUint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("minipool.item", index, ".avaxLiquidStakerAmt")));
675:		uint256 expectedAVAXRewardsAmt = getExpectedAVAXRewardsAmt(duration, avaxLiquidStakerAmt);
676:		uint256 slashGGPAmt = calculateGGPSlashAmt(expectedAVAXRewardsAmt);

...

681:		Staking staking = Staking(getContractAddress("Staking"));
682:		staking.slashGGP(owner, slashGGPAmt);
683:	}
```

This is then subtracted from their staked amount:

```javascript
File: Staking.sol

94: 	function decreaseGGPStake(address stakerAddr, uint256 amount) internal {
95: 		int256 stakerIndex = requireValidStaker(stakerAddr);
96: 		subUint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("staker.item", stakerIndex, ".ggpStaked")), amount); // can fail due to underflow
97: 	}

...

379:	function slashGGP(address stakerAddr, uint256 ggpAmt) public onlySpecificRegisteredContract("MinipoolManager", msg.sender) {
380:		Vault vault = Vault(getContractAddress("Vault"));
381:		decreaseGGPStake(stakerAddr, ggpAmt);
382:		vault.transferToken("ProtocolDAO", ggp, ggpAmt);
383:	}
```

The issue is that the current staked amount is never checked so the `subUint` can fail due to underflow if the price has changed since the minipool was created/recreated.

#### Impact

If a node operator doesn't have enough collateral, possibly caused by price changes in `GGP` during slashing they evade slashing all together.

It's even possible for the node operator to foresee this and manipulate the price of `GGP` just prior to the period ending if they know that they are going to be slashed.

#### Proof of Concept

PoC test in `MinipoolManager.t.sol`:

```javascript
	function testRecordStakingEndWithSlashNotEnoughStake() public {
		uint256 duration = 365 days;
		uint256 depositAmt = 1000 ether;
		uint256 avaxAssignmentRequest = 1000 ether;
		uint256 validationAmt = depositAmt + avaxAssignmentRequest;
		uint128 ggpStakeAmt = 100 ether; // just enough

		vm.startPrank(nodeOp);
		ggp.approve(address(staking), MAX_AMT);
		staking.stakeGGP(ggpStakeAmt);
		MinipoolManager.Minipool memory mp1 = createMinipool(depositAmt, avaxAssignmentRequest, duration);
		vm.stopPrank();

		address liqStaker1 = getActorWithTokens("liqStaker1", MAX_AMT, MAX_AMT);
		vm.prank(liqStaker1);
		ggAVAX.depositAVAX{value: MAX_AMT}();

		vm.prank(address(rialto));
		minipoolMgr.claimAndInitiateStaking(mp1.nodeID);

		bytes32 txID = keccak256("txid");
		vm.prank(address(rialto));
		minipoolMgr.recordStakingStart(mp1.nodeID, txID, block.timestamp);

		skip(2 weeks);

		vm.prank(address(rialto)); // price changes just a bit
		oracle.setGGPPriceInAVAX(0.999 ether, block.timestamp);

		vm.prank(address(rialto));
		vm.expectRevert(); // staking cannot end because of underflow
		minipoolMgr.recordStakingEnd{value: validationAmt}(mp1.nodeID, block.timestamp, 0 ether);
	}
```

The only thing the protocol can do now is to call `recordStakingError` for the minipool, since no other state changes are allowed. This will return the staked funds but it will not slash the `GGP` amount for the node operator. Hence the node operator has evaded the slashing.

#### Tools Used

vs code, forge

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

If the amount to be slashed is greater than what the node operator has staked, slash all their stake.

[https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/main/contracts/contract/MinipoolManager.sol#L196-L269](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/main/contracts/contract/MinipoolManager.sol#L196-L269)\

When a node operator creates a minipool they pass which duration they want to stake for. There is no validation for this field so they can pass any field:

```javascript
File: MinipoolManager.sol

196:	function createMinipool(
197:		address nodeID,
198:		uint256 duration,
199:		uint256 delegationFee,
200:		uint256 avaxAssignmentRequest
201:	) external payable whenNotPaused {

...     // no validation for duration

256:		setUint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("minipool.item", minipoolIndex, ".status")), uint256(MinipoolStatus.Prelaunch));
257:		setUint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("minipool.item", minipoolIndex, ".duration")), duration); // duration stored
258:		setUint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("minipool.item", minipoolIndex, ".delegationFee")), delegationFee);
```

Later when staking is done. if the node op was slashed, `duration` is used to calculate the slashing amount:

```javascript
File: MinipoolManager.sol

557:	function getExpectedAVAXRewardsAmt(uint256 duration, uint256 avaxAmt) public view returns (uint256) {
558:		ProtocolDAO dao = ProtocolDAO(getContractAddress("ProtocolDAO"));
559:		uint256 rate = dao.getExpectedAVAXRewardsRate();
560:		return (avaxAmt.mulWadDown(rate) * duration) / 365 days;
561:	}

...

670:	function slash(int256 index) private {

...

673:		uint256 duration = getUint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("minipool.item", index, ".duration")));
674:		uint256 avaxLiquidStakerAmt = getUint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("minipool.item", index, ".avaxLiquidStakerAmt")));
675:		uint256 expectedAVAXRewardsAmt = getExpectedAVAXRewardsAmt(duration, avaxLiquidStakerAmt);
676:		uint256 slashGGPAmt = calculateGGPSlashAmt(expectedAVAXRewardsAmt);
```

The node operator cannot pass in `0` because that reverts due to zero transfer check in Vault. However the node operator can pass in `1` to guarantee the lowest slash amount possible.

Rialto might fail this, but there is little information about how Rialto uses the `duration` passed. According to this comment they might default to `14 days` in which this finding is valid:

> JohnnyGault — 12/30/2022 3:22 PM

> To clarify duration for everyone -- a nodeOp can choose a duration they want, from 14 days to 365 days. But behind the scenes, Rialto will only create a validator for 14 days. ...

#### Impact

The node operator can send in a very low `duration` to get minimize slashing amounts. It depends on the implementation in Rialto, which we cannot see. Hence submitting this.

#### Proof of Concept

PoC test in `MinipoolManager.t.sol`:

```javascript
	function testRecordStakingEndWithSlashZeroDuration() public {
		uint256 duration = 1; // zero duration causes vault to fail on 0 amount
		uint256 depositAmt = 1000 ether;
		uint256 avaxAssignmentRequest = 1000 ether;
		uint256 validationAmt = depositAmt + avaxAssignmentRequest;
		uint128 ggpStakeAmt = 200 ether;

		vm.startPrank(nodeOp);
		ggp.approve(address(staking), MAX_AMT);
		staking.stakeGGP(ggpStakeAmt);
		MinipoolManager.Minipool memory mp1 = createMinipool(depositAmt, avaxAssignmentRequest, duration);
		vm.stopPrank();

		address liqStaker1 = getActorWithTokens("liqStaker1", MAX_AMT, MAX_AMT);
		vm.prank(liqStaker1);
		ggAVAX.depositAVAX{value: MAX_AMT}();

		vm.prank(address(rialto));
		minipoolMgr.claimAndInitiateStaking(mp1.nodeID);

		bytes32 txID = keccak256("txid");
		vm.prank(address(rialto));
		minipoolMgr.recordStakingStart(mp1.nodeID, txID, block.timestamp);

		skip(2 weeks);

		vm.prank(address(rialto));
		minipoolMgr.recordStakingEnd{value: validationAmt}(mp1.nodeID, block.timestamp, 0 ether);

		assertEq(vault.balanceOf("MinipoolManager"), depositAmt);

		int256 minipoolIndex = minipoolMgr.getIndexOf(mp1.nodeID);
		MinipoolManager.Minipool memory mp1Updated = minipoolMgr.getMinipool(minipoolIndex);
		assertEq(mp1Updated.status, uint256(MinipoolStatus.Withdrawable));
		assertEq(mp1Updated.avaxTotalRewardAmt, 0);
		assertTrue(mp1Updated.endTime != 0);

		assertEq(mp1Updated.avaxNodeOpRewardAmt, 0);
		assertEq(mp1Updated.avaxLiquidStakerRewardAmt, 0);

		assertEq(minipoolMgr.getTotalAVAXLiquidStakerAmt(), 0);

		assertEq(staking.getAVAXAssigned(mp1Updated.owner), 0);
		assertEq(staking.getMinipoolCount(mp1Updated.owner), 0);

		// very small slash amount
		assertLt(mp1Updated.ggpSlashAmt, 0.000_01 ether);
		assertGt(staking.getGGPStake(mp1Updated.owner), ggpStakeAmt - 0.000_01 ether);
	}
```

#### Tools Used

vs code, forge

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Regardless if Rialto will fail this or not, I recommend that the `duration` passed is validated to be within `14 days` and `365 days`.

[https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/tokens/TokenggAVAX.sol#L180-L189](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/tokens/TokenggAVAX.sol#L180-L189)

Function `syncRewards()` distributes rewards to TokenggAVAX holders, it linearly distribute cycle's rewards from `block.timestamp` to the cycle end time which is next multiple of the `rewardsCycleLength` (the end time of the cycle is defined and the real duration of the cycle changes). when a cycle ends `syncRewards()` should be called so the next cycle starts but if `syncRewards()` doesn't get called fast, then users depositing or withdrawing funds before call to `syncRewards()` would lose their rewards and those rewards would go to users who deposited funds after `syncRewards()` call. contract should try to start the next cycle whenever deposit or withdraw happens to make sure rewards are distributed fairly between users.

#### Proof of Concept

This is `syncRewards()` code:

```
	function syncRewards() public {
		uint32 timestamp = block.timestamp.safeCastTo32();

		if (timestamp < rewardsCycleEnd) {
			revert SyncError();
		}

		uint192 lastRewardsAmt_ = lastRewardsAmt;
		uint256 totalReleasedAssets_ = totalReleasedAssets;
		uint256 stakingTotalAssets_ = stakingTotalAssets;

		uint256 nextRewardsAmt = (asset.balanceOf(address(this)) + stakingTotalAssets_) - totalReleasedAssets_ - lastRewardsAmt_;

		// Ensure nextRewardsCycleEnd will be evenly divisible by `rewardsCycleLength`.
		uint32 nextRewardsCycleEnd = ((timestamp + rewardsCycleLength) / rewardsCycleLength) * rewardsCycleLength;

		lastRewardsAmt = nextRewardsAmt.safeCastTo192();
		lastSync = timestamp;
		rewardsCycleEnd = nextRewardsCycleEnd;
		totalReleasedAssets = totalReleasedAssets_ + lastRewardsAmt_;
		emit NewRewardsCycle(nextRewardsCycleEnd, nextRewardsAmt);
	}
```

As you can see whenever this function is called it starts the new cycle and sets the end of the cycle to the next multiple of the `rewardsCycleLength` and it release the rewards linearly between current timestamp and cycle end time. So if `syncRewards()` get called near to multiple of the `rewardsCycleLength` then rewards would be distributed with higher speed in less time. The problem is that users depositing funds before call `syncRewards()` won't receive new cycles rewards and early depositing won't get considered in reward distribution if deposits happen before `syncRewards()` call and if a user withdraws his funds before the `syncRewards()` call then he receives no rewards.

Imagine this scenario:

1. `rewardsCycleLength` is 10 days and the rewards for the next cycle is `100` AVAX.
2. the last cycle has been ended and user1 has `10000` AVAX deposited and has 50% of the pool shares.
3. `syncRewards()` don't get called for 8 days.
4. users1 withdraws his funds receive `10000` AVAX even so he deposits for 8 days in the current cycle.
5. users2 deposit `1000` AVAX and get 10% of pool shares and the user2 would call `syncRewards()` and contract would start distributing `100` avax as reward.
6. after 2 days cycle would finish and user2 would receive `100 * 10% = 10` AVAX as rewards for his `1000` AVAX deposit for 2 days but user1 had `10000` AVAX for 8 days and would receive 0 rewards.

So rewards won't distribute fairly between depositors across the time and any user interacting with contract before the `syncRewards()` call can lose his rewards. Contract won't consider deposit amounts and duration before `syncRewards()` call and it won't make sure that `syncRewards()` logic would be executed as early as possible with deposit or withdraw calls when a cycle ends.

#### Tools Used

VIM

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

One way to solve this is to call `syncRewards()` logic in each deposit or withdraw and make sure that cycles start as early as possible (the revert "SyncError()" in the `syncRewards()` should be removed for this).

### [\[M-16\] `maxWithdraw()` and `maxRedeem()` doesn't return correct value which can make other contracts fail while working with protocol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool-findings/issues/476)

_Submitted by_ [_unforgiven_](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool-findings/issues/476)

[https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/tokens/TokenggAVAX.sol#L215-L223](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/tokens/TokenggAVAX.sol#L215-L223)\
[https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/tokens/TokenggAVAX.sol#L205-L213](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/tokens/TokenggAVAX.sol#L205-L213)

Functions `maxWithdraw()` and `maxRedeem()` returns max amount of assets or shares owner would be able to withdraw taking into account liquidity in the TokenggAVAX contract, but logics don't consider that when user withdraws the withdrawal amounts subtracted from `totalReleasedAssets` (in `beforeWithdraw()` function) so the maximum amounts that can user withdraws should always be lower than `totalReleasedAssets` (which shows all the deposits and withdraws) but because functions `maxWithdraw()` and `maxRedeem()` uses `totalAssets()` to calculate available AVAX which includes deposits and current cycle rewards so those functions would return wrong value (whenever the return value is bigger than `totalReleaseAssets` then it would be wrong).

#### Proof of Concept

This is `beforeWithdraw()` code:

```
	function beforeWithdraw(
		uint256 amount,
		uint256 /* shares */
	) internal override {
		totalReleasedAssets -= amount;
	}
```

This is `beforeWithdraw()` code which is called whenever users withdraws their funds and as you can see the amount of withdrawal assets subtracted from `totalReleaseAssets` so withdrawal amounts can never be bigger than `totalReleaseAssets`. This is `maxWithdraw()` code:

```
	function maxWithdraw(address _owner) public view override returns (uint256) {
		if (getBool(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("contract.paused", "TokenggAVAX")))) {
			return 0;
		}
		uint256 assets = convertToAssets(balanceOf[_owner]);
		uint256 avail = totalAssets() - stakingTotalAssets;
		return assets > avail ? avail : assets;
	}
```

As you can see to calculate available AVAX in the contract address code uses `totalAssets() - stakingTotalAssets` and `totalAssets()` shows deposits + current cycle rewards so `totalAssets()` is bigger than `totalReleaseAssets` and the value of the `totalAssets() - stakingTotalAssets` can be bigger than `totalReleaseAssets` and if code returns `avail` as answer then the return value would be wrong.

Imagine this scenario:

1. `totalReleaseAssets` is `10000` AVAX.
2. `stakingTotalAssets` is `1000` AVAX.
3. current cycle rewards is `4000` AVAX and `block.timestamp` is currently in the middle of the cycle so current rewards is `2000` AVAX.
4. `totalAssets()` is `totalReleaseAssets + current rewards = 10000 + 2000 = 12000`.
5. contract balance is `10000 + 4000 - 1000 = 13000` AVAX.
6. user1 has 90% contract shares and calls `maxWithdraw()` and code would calculate user assets as `10800` AVAX and available AVAX in contract as `totalAssets() - stakingTotalAssets = 12000 - 1000 = 11000` and code would return `10800` as answer.
7. now if user1 withdraws `10800` AVAX code would revert in the function `beforeWithdraw()` because code would try to execute `totalReleaseAssets = totalReleaseAssets - amount = 10000 - 10800` and it would revert because of the underflow. so in reality user1 couldn't withdraw `10800` AVAX which was the return value of the `maxWithdraw()` for user1.

The root cause of the bug is that the withdrawal amount is subtracted from `totalReleaseAssets` and so max withdrawal can never be `totalReleaseAssets` and function `maxWithdraw()` should never return value bigger than `totalReleaseAssets`. (the bug in function `maxRedeem()` is similar)

This bug would cause other contract or front end calls to fail, for example if the logic is something like this:

```
   amount = maxWithdraw(user);
   TokenggAVAX.withdrawAVAX(amount);
```

According the function definitions this code should work bug because of the the issue there are situations that this would revert and other contracts and UI can't work properly with the protocol.

#### Tools Used

VIM

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider `totalReleaseAssets` in max withdrawal amount too.

The [documentation](https://multisiglabs.notion.site/Architecture-Protocol-Overview-4b79e351133f4d959a65a15478ec0121) says that the NodeOps could be elegible for GGP rewards if they have a valid minipool. The problem is that if the MiniPool [has an error](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/MinipoolManager.sol#L484) while registering the node as a validator, the NodeOp can get rewards even if the minipool had an error.

When the Rialto calls `recordStakingError()` function the `AssignedHighWater` is not reseted. So the malicious NodeOp (staker) can create pools which will have an error in the registration and get rewards from the protocol.

#### Proof of Concept

I created a test in `ClaimNodeOp.t.sol`:

1. NodeOp1 creates minipool
2. Rialto calls claimAndInitiateStaking, recordStakingStart and recordStakingError()
3. NodeOp1 withdraw his funds from minipool
4. NodeOp1 can get rewards even if there was an error with the node registration as validator.

```solidity
function testRecordStakingErrorCanGetRewards() public {
    // NodeOp can get rewards even if there was an error in registering the node as a validator
    // 1. NodeOp1 creates minipool
    // 2. Rialot/multisig claimAndInitiateStaking, recordStakingStart and recordStakingError
    // 3. NodeOp1 withdraw his funds from minipool
    // 4. NodeOp1 can get rewards even if there was an error with the node registration as validator.
    address nodeOp1 = getActorWithTokens("nodeOp1", MAX_AMT, MAX_AMT);
    uint256 duration = 2 weeks;
    uint256 depositAmt = 1000 ether;
    uint256 avaxAssignmentRequest = 1000 ether;
    skip(dao.getRewardsCycleSeconds());
    rewardsPool.startRewardsCycle();
    //
    // 1. NodeOp1 creates minipool
    //
    vm.startPrank(nodeOp1);
    ggp.approve(address(staking), MAX_AMT);
    staking.stakeGGP(200 ether);
    MinipoolManager.Minipool memory mp1 = createMinipool(depositAmt, avaxAssignmentRequest, duration);
    vm.stopPrank();
    address liqStaker1 = getActorWithTokens("liqStaker1", MAX_AMT, MAX_AMT);
    vm.prank(liqStaker1);
    ggAVAX.depositAVAX{value: MAX_AMT}();
    //
    // 2. Rialto/multisig claimAndInitiateStaking, recordStakingStart and recordStakingError

    vm.prank(address(rialto));
    minipoolMgr.claimAndInitiateStaking(mp1.nodeID);
    bytes32 txID = keccak256("txid");
    vm.prank(address(rialto));
    minipoolMgr.recordStakingStart(mp1.nodeID, txID, block.timestamp);
    bytes32 errorCode = "INVALID_NODEID";
    int256 minipoolIndex = minipoolMgr.getIndexOf(mp1.nodeID);
    skip(2 weeks);
    vm.prank(address(rialto));
    minipoolMgr.recordStakingError{value: depositAmt + avaxAssignmentRequest}(mp1.nodeID, errorCode);
    assertEq(vault.balanceOf("MinipoolManager"), depositAmt);
    MinipoolManager.Minipool memory mp1Updated = minipoolMgr.getMinipool(minipoolIndex);

    assertEq(mp1Updated.avaxLiquidStakerRewardAmt, 0);
    assertEq(minipoolMgr.getTotalAVAXLiquidStakerAmt(), 0);
    assertEq(staking.getAVAXAssigned(mp1Updated.owner), 0);
    // The highwater doesnt get reset in this case
    assertEq(staking.getAVAXAssignedHighWater(mp1Updated.owner), depositAmt);
    //
    // 3. NodeOp1 withdraw his funds from the minipool
    //
    vm.startPrank(nodeOp1);
    uint256 priorBalance_nodeOp = nodeOp1.balance;
    minipoolMgr.withdrawMinipoolFunds(mp1.nodeID);
    assertEq((nodeOp1.balance - priorBalance_nodeOp), depositAmt);
    vm.stopPrank();
    //
    // 4. NodeOp1 can get rewards even if there was an error with the node registration as validator.
    //
    skip(2629756);
    vm.startPrank(address(rialto));
    assertTrue(nopClaim.isEligible(nodeOp1)); //<- The NodeOp1 is eligible for rewards
    nopClaim.calculateAndDistributeRewards(nodeOp1, 200 ether);
    vm.stopPrank();
    assertGt(staking.getGGPRewards(nodeOp1), 0);
    vm.startPrank(address(nodeOp1));
    nopClaim.claimAndRestake(staking.getGGPRewards(nodeOp1)); //<- Claim nodeOp1 rewards
    vm.stopPrank();
}
```

#### Tools used

Foundry/VsCode

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

The `MinipoolManager.sol::recordStakingError()` function should reset the Assigned high water `staking.resetAVAXAssignedHighWater(stakerAddr);` so the user can not claim rewards for a minipool with errors.

The `totalReleasedAssets` variable is updated on the [syncRewards()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/tokens/TokenggAVAX.sol#L88) function if someone calls the function before `rewardsCycleEnd` the [redeemAVAX()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/tokens/TokenggAVAX.sol#L191) will be reverted because the `totalReleasedAssets` may not include all the rewards.

The ggAvax holder can not redeem his funds until the `rewardsCycleEnd`.

#### Proof of Concept

I did the next test:

1. Create minipool (2000 avax)
2. Deposit rewards to the minipool (200 AVAX rewards)
3. Sync the rewards before the cycle ends
4. Redeem function will revert
5. Redeem will be available after the cycle end

```solidity
function testRedeemUnderOverFlow() public {
    // Redeem function reverts arithmetic error
    // 1.- Create minipool
    // 2.- Deposit rewards to the minipool
    // 3.- Sync the Rewards before the cycle end
    // 4.- Redeem function will revert
    // 5.- Redeem will be available after the cycle end.
    // Deposit liquid staker funds
    uint256 depositAmount = 1200 ether;
    uint256 nodeAmt = 2000 ether;
    uint128 ggpStakeAmt = 200 ether;
    vm.deal(bob, depositAmount);
    vm.prank(bob);
    ggAVAX.depositAVAX{value: depositAmount}();//Avax deposit 1200
    //
    // 1.- Create minipool
    //
    address nodeOp = getActorWithTokens("nodeOp", uint128(depositAmount), ggpStakeAmt);
    // Nodeop stake GGP and create minipoool
    vm.startPrank(nodeOp);
    ggp.approve(address(staking), ggpStakeAmt);
    staking.stakeGGP(ggpStakeAmt);
    MinipoolManager.Minipool memory mp = createMinipool(nodeAmt / 2, nodeAmt / 2, duration);
    vm.stopPrank();
    // Rialto init recordStakingStart
    vm.startPrank(address(rialto));
    minipoolMgr.claimAndInitiateStaking(mp.nodeID);
    minipoolMgr.recordStakingStart(mp.nodeID, randHash(), block.timestamp);
    vm.stopPrank();
    skip(mp.duration);
    //
    // 2.- Deposit rewards to the minipool
    //
    uint256 rewardsAmt = nodeAmt.mulDivDown(0.1 ether, 1 ether);
    console.log("Rewards amount:", rewardsAmt / 1 ether);
    vm.deal(address(rialto), address(rialto).balance + rewardsAmt);
    vm.prank(address(rialto));
    minipoolMgr.recordStakingEnd{value: nodeAmt + rewardsAmt}(mp.nodeID, block.timestamp, rewardsAmt);
    //
    // 3.- Sync the Rewards before the cycle end
    //
    ggAVAX.syncRewards();
    uint256 maxRedeemSharesBob = ggAVAX.maxRedeem(bob);
    console.log("TotalReleasedAssets after syncRewards:", ggAVAX.totalReleasedAssets() / 1 ether);
    console.log("LastRewards after syncRewards:", ggAVAX.lastRewardsAmt() / 1 ether);
    console.log("Bob maxRedeem():", maxRedeemSharesBob / 1 ether);
    //
    // 4.- Redeem function will revert
    //
    skip(1 days);
    console.log("Bob PreviewRedeem() after skip one day:", ggAVAX.previewRedeem(maxRedeemSharesBob) / 1 ether);
    vm.prank(bob);
    vm.expectRevert(stdError.arithmeticError); // Revert by arithmetic error
    ggAVAX.redeemAVAX(maxRedeemSharesBob);
    //
    // 5.- Redeem will be available after the cycle end.
    //
    skip(ggAVAX.rewardsCycleLength() + 1 days);
    ggAVAX.syncRewards();
    maxRedeemSharesBob = ggAVAX.maxRedeem(bob);
    console.log("");
    console.log("TotalReleasedAssets after syncRewards:", ggAVAX.totalReleasedAssets() / 1 ether);
    console.log("LastRewards after syncRewards:", ggAVAX.lastRewardsAmt() / 1 ether);
    console.log("Bob maxRedeem():", maxRedeemSharesBob / 1 ether);
    console.log("Bob PreviewRedeem() after skip to the cycle end:", ggAVAX.previewRedeem(maxRedeemSharesBob) / 1 ether);
    vm.prank(bob);
    ggAVAX.redeemAVAX(maxRedeemSharesBob);
}
```

Output:

```
[PASS] testRedeemUnderOverFlow() (gas: 1244356)

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider redeem the max available amount for the shares owner instead of revert. The `maxRedeem()` function amount is not the same as the `previewRedeem()` amount.

The `MinipoolManager.recordStakingError` function ([https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/MinipoolManager.sol#L484-L515](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/MinipoolManager.sol#L484-L515)) does not decrease the `minipoolCount` of the staker.

This means that if a staker has a minipool that encounters an error, his `minipoolCount` can never go to zero again.

This is bad because the `minipoolCount` is used in `ClaimNodeOp.calculateAndDistributeRewards` to determine if the `rewardsStartTime` of the staker should be reset ([https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/ClaimNodeOp.sol#L81-L84](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/ClaimNodeOp.sol#L81-L84)).

Since the `minipoolCount` cannot go to zero, the `rewardsStartTime` will never be reset.

This means that the staker is immediately eligible for rewards when he creates a minipool again whereas he should have to wait `rewardsEligibilityMinSeconds` before he is eligible (which is 14 days at the moment) ([https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/ClaimNodeOp.sol#L51](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/ClaimNodeOp.sol#L51)).

To conclude, failing to decrease the `minipoolCount` allows the staker to earn higher rewards because he is eligible for staking right after he creates a new minipool and does not have to wait again.

#### Proof of Concept

I have created the following test that you can add to the `MinipoolManager.t.sol` file that logs the `minipoolCount` in the `Staking`, `Error` and `Finished` state.

The `minipoolCount` is always `1` although it should decrease to `0` when `recordStakingError` is called.

```solidity
function testRecordStakingErrorWrongMinipoolCount() public {
    uint256 duration = 2 weeks;
    uint256 depositAmt = 1000 ether;
    uint256 avaxAssignmentRequest = 1000 ether;
    uint256 validationAmt = depositAmt + avaxAssignmentRequest;
    uint128 ggpStakeAmt = 200 ether;

    vm.startPrank(nodeOp);
    ggp.approve(address(staking), MAX_AMT);
    staking.stakeGGP(ggpStakeAmt);
    MinipoolManager.Minipool memory mp1 = createMinipool(depositAmt, avaxAssignmentRequest, duration);
    vm.stopPrank();

    address liqStaker1 = getActorWithTokens("liqStaker1", MAX_AMT, MAX_AMT);
    vm.prank(liqStaker1);
    ggAVAX.depositAVAX{value: MAX_AMT}();

    vm.prank(address(rialto));
    minipoolMgr.claimAndInitiateStaking(mp1.nodeID);

    bytes32 txID = keccak256("txid");
    vm.prank(address(rialto));
    minipoolMgr.recordStakingStart(mp1.nodeID, txID, block.timestamp);

    bytes32 errorCode = "INVALID_NODEID";

    int256 minipoolIndex = minipoolMgr.getIndexOf(mp1.nodeID);

    vm.prank(nodeOp);
    // minipool count when in "Staking" state: 1
    console.log(staking.getMinipoolCount(nodeOp));
    vm.prank(address(rialto));
    minipoolMgr.recordStakingError{value: validationAmt}(mp1.nodeID, errorCode);
    vm.prank(nodeOp);
    // minipool count when in "Error" state: 1
    console.log(staking.getMinipoolCount(nodeOp));

    vm.prank(address(rialto));

    assertEq(vault.balanceOf("MinipoolManager"), depositAmt);

    MinipoolManager.Minipool memory mp1Updated = minipoolMgr.getMinipool(minipoolIndex);

    vm.prank(address(rialto));
    minipoolMgr.finishFailedMinipoolByMultisig(mp1Updated.nodeID);
    MinipoolManager.Minipool memory mp1finished = minipoolMgr.getMinipool(minipoolIndex);
    vm.prank(nodeOp);
    // minipool count when in "Finished" state: 1
    console.log(staking.getMinipoolCount(nodeOp));
}
```

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

You need to simply add the line `staking.decreaseMinipoolCount(owner);` to the `MinipoolManager.recordStakingError` function.

### [\[M-20\] TokenggAVAX: maxDeposit and maxMint return wrong value when contract is paused](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool-findings/issues/144)

_Submitted by_ [_HollaDieWaldfee_](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool-findings/issues/144)_, also found by_ [_aviggiano_](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool-findings/issues/247)

The `TokenggAVAX` contract ([https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/tokens/TokenggAVAX.sol#L24](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/tokens/TokenggAVAX.sol#L24)) can be paused.

The `whenTokenNotPaused` modifier is applied to the following functions ([https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/tokens/TokenggAVAX.sol#L225-L239](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/tokens/TokenggAVAX.sol#L225-L239)):\
`previewDeposit`, `previewMint`, `previewWithdraw` and `previewRedeem`

Thereby any calls to functions that deposit or withdraw funds revert.

There are two functions (`maxWithdraw` and `maxRedeem`) that calculate the max amount that can be withdrawn or redeemed respectively.

Both functions return `0` if the `TokenggAVAX` contract is paused.

The issue is that `TokenggAVAX` does not override the `maxDeposit` and `maxMint` functions ([https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/tokens/upgradeable/ERC4626Upgradeable.sol#L156-L162](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/tokens/upgradeable/ERC4626Upgradeable.sol#L156-L162)) in the `ERC4626Upgradable` contract like it does for `maxWithdraw` and `maxRedeem`.

Thereby these two functions return a value that cannot actually be deposited or minted.

This can cause any components that rely on any of these functions to return a correct value to malfunction.

So `maxDeposit` and `maxMint` should return the value `0` when `TokenggAVAX` is paused.

#### Proof of Concept

1. The `TokenggAVAX` contract is paused by calling `Ocyticus.pauseEverything` ([https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/Ocyticus.sol#L37-L43](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/Ocyticus.sol#L37-L43))
2. `TokenggAVAX.maxDeposit` returns `type(uint256).max` ([https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/tokens/upgradeable/ERC4626Upgradeable.sol#L157](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/tokens/upgradeable/ERC4626Upgradeable.sol#L157))
3. However `deposit` cannot be called with this value because it is paused (`previewDeposit` reverts because of the `whenTokenNotPaused` modifier) ([https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/tokens/upgradeable/ERC4626Upgradeable.sol#L44](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/tokens/upgradeable/ERC4626Upgradeable.sol#L44))

#### Tools Used

VSCode

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

The `maxDeposit` and `maxMint` functions should be overridden by `TokenggAVAX` just like `maxWithdraw` and `maxRedeem` are overridden and return `0` when the contract is paused ([https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/tokens/TokenggAVAX.sol#L206-L223](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/tokens/TokenggAVAX.sol#L206-L223)).

So add these two functions to the `TokenggAVAX` contract:

```solidity
function maxDeposit(address) public view override returns (uint256) {
    if (getBool(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("contract.paused", "TokenggAVAX")))) {
        return 0;
    }
    return return type(uint256).max;
}

function maxMint(address) public view override returns (uint256) {
    if (getBool(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("contract.paused", "TokenggAVAX")))) {
        return 0;
    }
    return return type(uint256).max;
}
```

### [\[M-21\] Division by zero error can block `RewardsPool#startRewardCycle` if all multisig wallet are disabled](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool-findings/issues/143)

[https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/RewardsPool.sol#L156](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/RewardsPool.sol#L156)

A user needs to call the function startRewardsCycle in RewardsPool.sol

```solidity
/// @notice Public function that will run a GGP rewards cycle if possible
function startRewardsCycle() external {
```

which calls:

```solidity
uint256 multisigClaimContractAllotment = getClaimingContractDistribution("ClaimMultisig");
uint256 nopClaimContractAllotment = getClaimingContractDistribution("ClaimNodeOp");
uint256 daoClaimContractAllotment = getClaimingContractDistribution("ClaimProtocolDAO");
if (daoClaimContractAllotment + nopClaimContractAllotment + multisigClaimContractAllotment > getRewardsCycleTotalAmt()) {
	revert IncorrectRewardsDistribution();
}

TokenGGP ggp = TokenGGP(getContractAddress("TokenGGP"));
Vault vault = Vault(getContractAddress("Vault"));

if (daoClaimContractAllotment > 0) {
	emit ProtocolDAORewardsTransfered(daoClaimContractAllotment);
	vault.transferToken("ClaimProtocolDAO", ggp, daoClaimContractAllotment);
}

if (multisigClaimContractAllotment > 0) {
	emit MultisigRewardsTransfered(multisigClaimContractAllotment);
	distributeMultisigAllotment(multisigClaimContractAllotment, vault, ggp);
}

if (nopClaimContractAllotment > 0) {
	emit ClaimNodeOpRewardsTransfered(nopClaimContractAllotment);
	ClaimNodeOp nopClaim = ClaimNodeOp(getContractAddress("ClaimNodeOp"));
	nopClaim.setRewardsCycleTotal(nopClaimContractAllotment);
	vault.transferToken("ClaimNodeOp", ggp, nopClaimContractAllotment);
}
```

We need to pay special attention to the code block below:

```solidity
if (multisigClaimContractAllotment > 0) {
	emit MultisigRewardsTransfered(multisigClaimContractAllotment);
	distributeMultisigAllotment(multisigClaimContractAllotment, vault, ggp);
}
```

which calls:

```solidity
/// @notice Distributes GGP to enabled Multisigs
/// @param allotment Total GGP for Multisigs
/// @param vault Vault contract
/// @param ggp TokenGGP contract
function distributeMultisigAllotment(
uint256 allotment,
Vault vault,
TokenGGP ggp
) internal {
MultisigManager mm = MultisigManager(getContractAddress("MultisigManager"));

uint256 enabledCount;
uint256 count = mm.getCount();
address[] memory enabledMultisigs = new address[](count);

// there should never be more than a few multisigs, so a loop should be fine here
for (uint256 i = 0; i < count; i++) {
	(address addr, bool enabled) = mm.getMultisig(i);
	if (enabled) {
		enabledMultisigs[enabledCount] = addr;
		enabledCount++;
	}
}

// Dirty hack to cut unused elements off end of return value (from RP)
// solhint-disable-next-line no-inline-assembly
assembly {
	mstore(enabledMultisigs, enabledCount)
}

uint256 tokensPerMultisig = allotment / enabledCount;
for (uint256 i = 0; i < enabledMultisigs.length; i++) {
	vault.withdrawToken(enabledMultisigs[i], ggp, tokensPerMultisig);
}
}
```

The code distributes the reward to all multisig evenly.

```solidity
uint256 tokensPerMultisig = allotment / enabledCount;
```

However, if the enabledCount is 0, meaning no multisig wallet is enabled, the transactions revert in division by zero error and revert the startRewardsCycle transaction.

As shown in POC.

In RewardsPool.t.sol,

we change the name from testStartRewardsCycle to testStartRewardsCycle\_POC

[https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/test/unit/RewardsPool.t.sol#L123](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/test/unit/RewardsPool.t.sol#L123)

we add the code to disable all multisig wallet. before calling rewardsPool.startRewardsCycle

[https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/test/unit/RewardsPool.t.sol#L138](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/test/unit/RewardsPool.t.sol#L138)

```solidity
// disable all multisg wallet
vm.prank(guardian);
ocyticus.disableAllMultisigs();
```

Then we run the test

```solidity
forge test -vvv --match testStartRewardsCycle_POC
```

the transaction revert in division by zero error, which block the startRewardsCycle

### [\[M-22\] Inaccurate estimation of validation rewards from function `ExpectedRewardAVA` in `MiniPoolManager.sol`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool-findings/issues/122)

_Submitted by_ [_ladboy233_](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool-findings/issues/122)_, also found by_ [_hansfriese_](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool-findings/issues/572)

[https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/MinipoolManager.sol#L560](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/MinipoolManager.sol#L560)\

The validation rewards can be inaccurately displayed to user and the slahsed amount can be wrong when slashing happens.

#### Proof of Concept

Note the function below:

```solidity
	/// @notice Given a duration and an AVAX amt, calculate how much AVAX should be earned via validation rewards
	/// @param duration The length of validation in seconds
	/// @param avaxAmt The amount of AVAX the node staked for their validation period
	/// @return The approximate rewards the node should recieve from Avalanche for beign a validator
	function getExpectedAVAXRewardsAmt(uint256 duration, uint256 avaxAmt) public view returns (uint256) {
		ProtocolDAO dao = ProtocolDAO(getContractAddress("ProtocolDAO"));
		uint256 rate = dao.getExpectedAVAXRewardsRate();
		return (avaxAmt.mulWadDown(rate) * duration) / 365 days;
	}
```

As outlined in the comment section, the function is intended to calculate how much AVAX should be earned via validation rewards.

Besides displaying the reward, this function is also used in the function slash.

```solidity
/// @notice Slashes the GPP of the minipool with the given index
/// @dev Extracted this because of "stack too deep" errors.
/// @param index Index of the minipool
function slash(int256 index) private {
	address nodeID = getAddress(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("minipool.item", index, ".nodeID")));
	address owner = getAddress(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("minipool.item", index, ".owner")));
	uint256 duration = getUint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("minipool.item", index, ".duration")));
	uint256 avaxLiquidStakerAmt = getUint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("minipool.item", index, ".avaxLiquidStakerAmt")));
	uint256 expectedAVAXRewardsAmt = getExpectedAVAXRewardsAmt(duration, avaxLiquidStakerAmt);
	uint256 slashGGPAmt = calculateGGPSlashAmt(expectedAVAXRewardsAmt);
	setUint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("minipool.item", index, ".ggpSlashAmt")), slashGGPAmt);

	emit GGPSlashed(nodeID, slashGGPAmt);

	Staking staking = Staking(getContractAddress("Staking"));
	staking.slashGGP(owner, slashGGPAmt);
}
```

Note the code:

```solidity
uint256 expectedAVAXRewardsAmt = getExpectedAVAXRewardsAmt(duration, avaxLiquidStakerAmt);
uint256 slashGGPAmt = calculateGGPSlashAmt(expectedAVAXRewardsAmt);
```

The slashedGGPAmt is calculated based on the AVAX reward amount.

However, the estimation of the validation rewards is not accurate.

According to the doc:

[https://docs.avax.network/nodes/build/set-up-an-avalanche-node-with-microsoft-azure](https://docs.avax.network/nodes/build/set-up-an-avalanche-node-with-microsoft-azure)

> Running a validator and staking with Avalanche provides extremely competitive rewards of between 9.69% and 11.54% depending on the length you stake for.

This implies that the staking length affect staking rewards, but this is kind of vague. What is the exact implementation of the reward calculation?

The implementation is linked below:

[https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego/blob/master/vms/platformvm/reward/calculator.go#L40](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego/blob/master/vms/platformvm/reward/calculator.go#L40)

```Golang
// Reward returns the amount of tokens to reward the staker with.
//
// RemainingSupply = SupplyCap - ExistingSupply
// PortionOfExistingSupply = StakedAmount / ExistingSupply
// PortionOfStakingDuration = StakingDuration / MaximumStakingDuration
// MintingRate = MinMintingRate + MaxSubMinMintingRate * PortionOfStakingDuration
// Reward = RemainingSupply * PortionOfExistingSupply * MintingRate * PortionOfStakingDuration
func (c *calculator) Calculate(stakedDuration time.Duration, stakedAmount, currentSupply uint64) uint64 {
	bigStakedDuration := new(big.Int).SetUint64(uint64(stakedDuration))
	bigStakedAmount := new(big.Int).SetUint64(stakedAmount)
	bigCurrentSupply := new(big.Int).SetUint64(currentSupply)

	adjustedConsumptionRateNumerator := new(big.Int).Mul(c.maxSubMinConsumptionRate, bigStakedDuration)
	adjustedMinConsumptionRateNumerator := new(big.Int).Mul(c.minConsumptionRate, c.mintingPeriod)
	adjustedConsumptionRateNumerator.Add(adjustedConsumptionRateNumerator, adjustedMinConsumptionRateNumerator)
	adjustedConsumptionRateDenominator := new(big.Int).Mul(c.mintingPeriod, consumptionRateDenominator)

	remainingSupply := c.supplyCap - currentSupply
	reward := new(big.Int).SetUint64(remainingSupply)
	reward.Mul(reward, adjustedConsumptionRateNumerator)
	reward.Mul(reward, bigStakedAmount)
	reward.Mul(reward, bigStakedDuration)
	reward.Div(reward, adjustedConsumptionRateDenominator)
	reward.Div(reward, bigCurrentSupply)
	reward.Div(reward, c.mintingPeriod)

	if !reward.IsUint64() {
		return remainingSupply
	}

	finalReward := reward.Uint64()
	if finalReward > remainingSupply {
		return remainingSupply
	}

	return finalReward
}
```

Note the reward calculation formula:

```solidity
// Reward returns the amount of tokens to reward the staker with.
//
// RemainingSupply = SupplyCap - ExistingSupply
// PortionOfExistingSupply = StakedAmount / ExistingSupply
// PortionOfStakingDuration = StakingDuration / MaximumStakingDuration
// MintingRate = MinMintingRate + MaxSubMinMintingRate * PortionOfStakingDuration
// Reward = RemainingSupply * PortionOfExistingSupply * MintingRate * PortionOfStakingDuration
```

However, in the current ExpectedRewardAVA, the implementation is just:

AVAX reward rate \* avax amount \* duration / 365 days.

```solidity
ProtocolDAO dao = ProtocolDAO(getContractAddress("ProtocolDAO"));
		uint256 rate = dao.getExpectedAVAXRewardsRate();
		return (avaxAmt.mulWadDown(rate) * duration) / 365 days;
```

Clearly, the implementation of the avalanche side is more sophisticated and accurate than the implemented ExpectedRewardAVA.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

We recommend the project make the ExpectedRewardAVA implementation match the implement.

### \[L‑01] Inflation not locked for four years

The [litepaper](https://docs.gogopool.com/about-gogopool/gogopool-litepaper) says that there will be no inflation for four years, but there is no code enforcing this.

_There is 1 instance of this issue:_

```solidity
File: /contracts/contract/ProtocolDAO.sol

39   		// GGP Inflation
40   		setUint(keccak256("ProtocolDAO.InflationIntervalSeconds"), 1 days);
41:  		setUint(keccak256("ProtocolDAO.InflationIntervalRate"), 1000133680617113500); // 5% annual calculated on a daily interval - Calculate in js example: let dailyInflation = web3.utils.toBN((1 + 0.05) ** (1 / (365)) * 1e18);

```

### \[L‑02] Contract will stop functioning in the year 2106

Limiting the timestamp to fit in a `uint32` will cause the call below to start reverting in 2106.

_There is 1 instance of this issue:_

```solidity
File: /contracts/contract/tokens/TokenggAVAX.sol

89:  		uint32 timestamp = block.timestamp.safeCastTo32();

```

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/tokens/TokenggAVAX.sol#L89

### \[L‑03] Lower-level initializations should come first

There may not be an issue now, but if `ERC4626` changes to rely on some of the functions `BaseUpgradeable` provides, things will break.

_There is 1 instance of this issue:_

```solidity
File: /contracts/contract/tokens/TokenggAVAX.sol

72   	function initialize(Storage storageAddress, ERC20 asset) public initializer {
73   		__ERC4626Upgradeable_init(asset, "GoGoPool Liquid Staking Token", "ggAVAX");
74:  		__BaseUpgradeable_init(storageAddress);

```

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/tokens/TokenggAVAX.sol#L72-L74

### \[L‑04] Incorrect percentage conversion

0.2 ether should be 20%, not 2%. [Other](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/ProtocolDAO.sol#L44) areas use 0.X as X0%.

_There is 1 instance of this issue:_

```solidity
File: /contracts/contract/MinipoolManager.sol

194: 	/// @param delegationFee Percentage delegation fee in units of ether (2% is 0.2 ether)

```

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/MinipoolManager.sol#L194

### \[L‑05] Loss of precision

Division by large numbers may result in the result being zero, due to solidity not supporting fractions. Consider requiring a minimum amount for the numerator to ensure that it is always larger than the denominator.

_There are 2 instances of this issue:_

```solidity
File: contracts/contract/RewardsPool.sol

60:   		return (block.timestamp - startTime) / dao.getInflationIntervalSeconds();

128:  		return (block.timestamp - startTime) / dao.getRewardsCycleSeconds();

```

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/RewardsPool.sol#L60

### \[L‑06] Signatures vulnerable to malleability attacks

`ecrecover()` accepts as valid, two versions of signatures, meaning an attacker can use the same signature twice. Consider adding checks for signature malleability, or using OpenZeppelin's `ECDSA` library to perform the extra checks necessary in order to prevent this attack.

_There is 1 instance of this issue:_

```solidity
File: contracts/contract/tokens/upgradeable/ERC20Upgradeable.sol

132   			address recoveredAddress = ecrecover(
133   				keccak256(
134   					abi.encodePacked(
135   						"\x19\x01",
136   						DOMAIN_SEPARATOR(),
137   						keccak256(
138   							abi.encode(
139   								keccak256("Permit(address owner,address spender,uint256 value,uint256 nonce,uint256 deadline)"),
140   								owner,
141   								spender,
142   								value,
143   								nonces[owner]++,
144   								deadline
145   							)
146   						)
147   					)
148   				),
149   				v,
150   				r,
151   				s
152:  			);

```

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/tokens/upgradeable/ERC20Upgradeable.sol#L132-L152

### \[L‑07] `require()` should be used instead of `assert()`

Prior to solidity version 0.8.0, hitting an assert consumes the **remainder of the transaction's available gas** rather than returning it, as `require()`/`revert()` do. `assert()` should be avoided even past solidity version 0.8.0 as its [documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.14/control-structures.html#panic-via-assert-and-error-via-require) states that "The assert function creates an error of type Panic(uint256). ... Properly functioning code should never create a Panic, not even on invalid external input. If this happens, then there is a bug in your contract which you should fix".

_There is 1 instance of this issue:_

```solidity
File: contracts/contract/tokens/TokenggAVAX.sol

83:   		assert(msg.sender == address(asset));

```

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/tokens/TokenggAVAX.sol#L83

### \[N‑01] Common code should be refactored

[BaseAbstract](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/BaseAbstract.sol#L71-L74) performs similar operations, so the common code should be refactored to a function

_There is 1 instance of this issue:_

```solidity
File: /contracts/contract/MultisigManager.sol

110: 		addr = getAddress(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("multisig.item", index, ".address")));

```

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/MultisigManager.sol#L110

### \[N‑02] String constants used in multiple places should be defined as constants

_There is 1 instance of this issue:_

```solidity
File: /contracts/contract/MultisigManager.sol

110: 		addr = getAddress(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("multisig.item", index, ".address")));

```

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/MultisigManager.sol#L110

### \[N‑03] Constants in comparisons should appear on the left side

Doing so will prevent [typo bugs](https://www.moserware.com/2008/01/constants-on-left-are-better-but-this.html).

_There is 1 instance of this issue:_

```solidity
File: /contracts/contract/ClaimNodeOp.sol

92:  		if (ggpRewards == 0) {

```

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/ClaimNodeOp.sol#L92

### \[N‑04] Inconsistent address separator in storage names

Most addresses in storage names don't separate the prefix from the address with a period, but this one has one.

_There is 1 instance of this issue:_

```solidity
File: /contracts/contract/ProtocolDAO.sol

102  	function getClaimingContractPct(string memory claimingContract) public view returns (uint256) {
103  		return getUint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("ProtocolDAO.ClaimingContractPct.", claimingContract)));
104  	}
105
106  	/// @notice Set the percentage a contract is owed for a rewards cycle
107  	function setClaimingContractPct(string memory claimingContract, uint256 decimal) public onlyGuardian valueNotGreaterThanOne(decimal) {
108  		setUint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("ProtocolDAO.ClaimingContractPct.", claimingContract)), decimal);
109: 	}

```

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/ProtocolDAO.sol#L102-L109

### \[N‑05] Confusing function name

Consider changing the name to `stakeGGPAs` or `stakeGGPFor`.

_There is 1 instance of this issue:_

```solidity
File: /contracts/contract/Staking.sol

328: 	function restakeGGP(address stakerAddr, uint256 amount) public onlySpecificRegisteredContract("ClaimNodeOp", msg.sender) {

```

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/Staking.sol#L328

### \[N‑06] Misplaced punctuation

There's an extra comma - it looks like a find-and-replace error.

_There is 1 instance of this issue:_

```solidity
File: /contracts/contract/Vault.sol

154  		// Update balances
155  		tokenBalances[contractKey] = tokenBalances[contractKey] - amount;
156  		// Get the toke ERC20 instance
157  		ERC20 tokenContract = ERC20(tokenAddress);
158  		// Withdraw to the withdrawal address, , safeTransfer will revert if it fails
159  		tokenContract.safeTransfer(withdrawalAddress, amount);
160: 	}

```

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/Vault.sol#L154-L160

### \[N‑07] Upgradeable contract is missing a `__gap[50]` storage variable to allow for new storage variables in later versions

See [this](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/upgradeable#storage\_gaps) link for a description of this storage variable. While some contracts may not currently be sub-classed, adding the variable now protects against forgetting to add it in the future.

_There is 1 instance of this issue:_

```solidity
File: contracts/contract/tokens/TokenggAVAX.sol

24:   contract TokenggAVAX is Initializable, ERC4626Upgradeable, UUPSUpgradeable, BaseUpgradeable {

```

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/tokens/TokenggAVAX.sol#L24

### \[N‑08] Import declarations should import specific identifiers, rather than the whole file

Using import declarations of the form `import {<identifier_name>} from "some/file.sol"` avoids polluting the symbol namespace making flattened files smaller, and speeds up compilation.

_There are 13 instances of this issue. (For in-depth details on this and all further issues with multiple instances, please see the warden's_ [_full report_](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool-findings/issues/728)_.)_

### \[N‑09] Missing `initializer` modifier on constructor

OpenZeppelin [recommends](https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/uupsupgradeable-vulnerability-post-mortem/15680/5) that the `initializer` modifier be applied to constructors in order to avoid potential griefs, [social engineering](https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/uupsupgradeable-vulnerability-post-mortem/15680/4), or exploits. Ensure that the modifier is applied to the implementation contract. If the default constructor is currently being used, it should be changed to be an explicit one with the modifier applied.

_There is 1 instance of this issue:_

```solidity
File: contracts/contract/BaseUpgradeable.sol

9:    contract BaseUpgradeable is Initializable, BaseAbstract {

```

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/BaseUpgradeable.sol#L9

### \[N‑10] The `nonReentrant` `modifier` should occur before all other modifiers

This is a best-practice to protect against reentrancy in other modifiers.

_There are 2 instances of this issue._

### \[N‑11] `override` function arguments that are unused should have the variable name removed or commented out to avoid compiler warnings

_There is 1 instance of this issue:_

```solidity
File: contracts/contract/tokens/TokenggAVAX.sol

255:  	function _authorizeUpgrade(address newImplementation) internal override onlyGuardian {}

```

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/tokens/TokenggAVAX.sol#L255

### \[N‑12] `constant`s should be defined rather than using magic numbers

Even [assembly](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-opensea-seaport/blob/9d7ce4d08bf3c3010304a0476a785c70c0e90ae7/contracts/lib/TokenTransferrer.sol#L35-L39) can benefit from using readable constants instead of hex/numeric literals.

_There are 2 instances of this issue._

### \[N‑13] Missing event and or timelock for critical parameter change

Events help non-contract tools to track changes, and events prevent users from being surprised by changes.

_There is 1 instance of this issue:_

```solidity
File: contracts/contract/Storage.sol

41    	function setGuardian(address newAddress) external {
42    		// Check tx comes from current guardian
43    		if (msg.sender != guardian) {
44    			revert MustBeGuardian();
45    		}
46    		// Store new address awaiting confirmation
47    		newGuardian = newAddress;
48:   	}

```

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/Storage.sol#L41-L48

### \[N‑14] Events that mark critical parameter changes should contain both the old and the new value

This should especially be done if the new value is not required to be different from the old value.

_There are 2 instances of this issue._

### \[N‑15] Use a more recent version of solidity

Use a solidity version of at least 0.8.13 to get the ability to use `using for` with a list of free functions.

_There is 1 instance of this issue:_

```solidity
File: contracts/contract/tokens/upgradeable/ERC4626Upgradeable.sol

2:    pragma solidity >=0.8.0;

```

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/tokens/upgradeable/ERC4626Upgradeable.sol#L2

### \[N‑16] Use a more recent version of solidity

* Use a solidity version of at least 0.8.4 to get `bytes.concat()` instead of `abi.encodePacked(<bytes>,<bytes>)`.
* Use a solidity version of at least 0.8.12 to get `string.concat()` instead of `abi.encodePacked(<str>,<str>)`.

### \[N‑17] Constant redefined elsewhere

Consider defining in only one contract so that values cannot become out of sync when only one location is updated. A [cheap way](https://medium.com/coinmonks/gas-cost-of-solidity-library-functions-dbe0cedd4678) to store constants in a single location is to create an `internal constant` in a `library`. If the variable is a local cache of another contract's value, consider making the cache variable internal or private, which will require external users to query the contract with the source of truth, so that callers don't get out of sync.

### \[N‑18] Lines are too long

Usually lines in source code are limited to [80](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/148677/why-is-80-characters-the-standard-limit-for-code-width) characters. Today's screens are much larger so it's reasonable to stretch this in some cases. Since the files will most likely reside in GitHub, and GitHub starts using a scroll bar in all cases when the length is over [164](https://github.com/aizatto/character-length) characters, the lines below should be split when they reach that length

### \[N‑19] Variable names that consist of all capital letters should be reserved for `constant`/`immutable` variables

If the variable needs to be different based on which class it comes from, a `view`/`pure` _function_ should be used instead (e.g. like [this](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/76eee35971c2541585e05cbf258510dda7b2fbc6/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/draft-IERC20Permit.sol#L59)).

### \[N‑20] Using `>`/`>=` without specifying an upper bound is unsafe

There _will_ be breaking changes in future versions of solidity, and at that point your code will no longer be compatable. While you may have the specific version to use in a configuration file, others that include your source files may not.

### \[N‑25] Contracts should have full test coverage

While 100% code coverage does not guarantee that there are no bugs, it often will catch easy-to-find bugs, and will ensure that there are fewer regressions when the code invariably has to be modified. Furthermore, in order to get full coverage, code authors will often have to re-organize their code so that it is more modular, so that each component can be tested separately, which reduces interdependencies between modules and layers, and makes for code that is easier to reason about and audit.

### \[N‑26] Large or complicated code bases should implement fuzzing tests

Large code bases, or code with lots of inline-assembly, complicated math, or complicated interactions between multiple contracts, should implement [fuzzing tests](https://medium.com/coinmonks/smart-contract-fuzzing-d9b88e0b0a05). Fuzzers such as Echidna require the test writer to come up with invariants which should not be violated under any circumstances, and the fuzzer tests various inputs and function calls to ensure that the invariants always hold. Even code with 100% code coverage can still have bugs due to the order of the operations a user performs, and fuzzers, with properly and extensively-written invariants, can close this testing gap significantly.

### \[N‑27] Function ordering does not follow the Solidity style guide

According to the [Solidity style guide](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/style-guide.html#order-of-functions), functions should be laid out in the following order :`constructor()`, `receive()`, `fallback()`, `external`, `public`, `internal`, `private`, but the cases below do not follow this pattern.

### \[N‑28] Contract does not follow the Solidity style guide's suggested layout ordering

The [style guide](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.16/style-guide.html#order-of-layout) says that, within a contract, the ordering should be 1) Type declarations, 2) State variables, 3) Events, 4) Modifiers, and 5) Functions, but the contract(s) below do not follow this ordering.

#### \[L‑09] `abi.encodePacked()` should not be used with dynamic types when passing the result to a hash function such as `keccak256()`

Use `abi.encode()` instead which will pad items to 32 bytes, which will [prevent hash collisions](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.13/abi-spec.html#non-standard-packed-mode) (e.g. `abi.encodePacked(0x123,0x456)` => `0x123456` => `abi.encodePacked(0x1,0x23456)`, but `abi.encode(0x123,0x456)` => `0x0...1230...456`). "Unless there is a compelling reason, `abi.encode` should be preferred". If there is only one argument to `abi.encodePacked()` it can often be cast to `bytes()` or `bytes32()` [instead](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/30912/how-to-compare-strings-in-solidity#answer-82739).

If all arguments are strings and or bytes, `bytes.concat()` should be used instead.

_There are 155 instances of this issue._

#### \[N‑30] Return values of `approve()` not checked

Not all `IERC20` implementations `revert()` when there's a failure in `approve()`. The function signature has a `boolean` return value and they indicate errors that way instead. By not checking the return value, operations that should have marked as failed, may potentially go through without actually approving anything.

_There are 2 instances of this issue._

#### \[N‑31] `public` functions not called by the contract should be declared `external` instead

Contracts [are allowed](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contracts.html#function-overriding) to override their parents' functions and change the visibility from `external` to `public`.

_There are 54 instances of this issue._

#### \[N‑32] Event is missing `indexed` fields

Index event fields make the field more quickly accessible [to off-chain tools](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/40396/can-somebody-please-explain-the-concept-of-event-indexing) that parse events. However, note that each index field costs extra gas during emission, so it's not necessarily best to index the maximum allowed per event (three fields). Each `event` should use three `indexed` fields if there are three or more fields, and gas usage is not particularly of concern for the events in question. If there are fewer than three fields, all of the fields should be indexed.

Total: 256 instances over 17 issues with **17165 gas** saved.

Gas totals use lower bounds of ranges and count two iterations of each `for`-loop. All values above are runtime, not deployment, values; deployment values are listed in the individual issue descriptions.

### \[G‑01] State variables can be packed into fewer storage slots

If variables occupying the same slot are both written by the same function or by the constructor, avoids a separate Gsset (**20000 gas**). Reads of the variables can also be cheaper.

### \[G‑02] Use a more recent version of solidity

* Use a solidity version of at least 0.8.2 to get simple compiler automatic inlining.
* Use a solidity version of at least 0.8.3 to get better struct packing and cheaper multiple storage reads.
* Use a solidity version of at least 0.8.4 to get custom errors, which are cheaper at deployment than `revert()/require()` strings.
* Use a solidity version of at least 0.8.10 to have external calls skip contract existence checks if the external call has a return value.

_There are 2 instances of this issue. (For in-depth details on this and all further gas optimizations with multiple instances, please see the warden's_ [_full report_](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool-findings/issues/125)_.)_

### \[G‑03] `++i`/`i++` should be `unchecked{++i}`/`unchecked{i++}` when it is not possible for them to overflow, as is the case when used in `for`- and `while`-loops

The `unchecked` keyword is new in solidity version 0.8.0, so this only applies to that version or higher, which these instances are. This saves **30-40 gas** [**per loop**](https://gist.github.com/hrkrshnn/ee8fabd532058307229d65dcd5836ddc#the-increment-in-for-loop-post-condition-can-be-made-unchecked).

_There are 10 instances of this issue._

### \[G‑04] `internal` functions only called once can be inlined to save gas

Not inlining costs **20 to 40 gas** because of two extra `JUMP` instructions and additional stack operations needed for function calls.

_There are 4 instances of this issue._

### \[G‑05] Functions guaranteed to revert when called by normal users can be marked `payable`

If a function modifier such as `onlyOwner` is used, the function will revert if a normal user tries to pay the function. Marking the function as `payable` will lower the gas cost for legitimate callers because the compiler will not include checks for whether a payment was provided. The extra opcodes avoided are `CALLVALUE`(2), `DUP1`(3), `ISZERO`(3), `PUSH2`(3), `JUMPI`(10), `PUSH1`(3), `DUP1`(3), `REVERT`(0), `JUMPDEST`(1), `POP`(2), which costs an average of about **21 gas per call** to the function, in addition to the extra deployment cost.

_There are 62 instances of this issue._

### \[G‑06] Optimize names to save gas

`public`/`external` function names and `public` member variable names can be optimized to save gas. See [this](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/a5d8b486a8259f9f77891a919febd1a9) link for an example of how it works. Below are the interfaces/abstract contracts that can be optimized so that the most frequently-called functions use the least amount of gas possible during method lookup. Method IDs that have two leading zero bytes can save **128 gas** each during deployment, and renaming functions to have lower method IDs will save **22 gas** per call, [per sorted position shifted](https://medium.com/joyso/solidity-how-does-function-name-affect-gas-consumption-in-smart-contract-47d270d8ac92).

_There are 13 instances of this issue._

### \[G‑07] Use custom errors rather than `revert()`/`require()` strings to save gas

Custom errors are available from solidity version 0.8.4. Custom errors save [**\~50 gas**](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/ad1bd0d29a0101b25e57c293b4b0c746) each time they're hit by [avoiding having to allocate and store the revert string](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2021/04/21/custom-errors/#errors-in-depth). Not defining the strings also save deployment gas.

_There are 4 instances of this issue._

### \[G‑08] Add `unchecked {}` for subtractions where the operands cannot underflow because of a previous `require()` or `if`-statement

`require(a <= b); x = b - a` => `require(a <= b); unchecked { x = b - a }`.

_There are 7 instances of this issue._

### \[G‑09] Multiple accesses of a mapping/array should use a local variable cache

The instances below point to the second+ access of a value inside a mapping/array, within a function. Caching a mapping's value in a local `storage` or `calldata` variable when the value is accessed [multiple times](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/ec23a57daa30a8f8ca8b9681c8ccefb0), saves **\~42 gas per access** due to not having to recalculate the key's keccak256 hash (Gkeccak256 - **30 gas**) and that calculation's associated stack operations. Caching an array's struct avoids recalculating the array offsets into memory/calldata.

_There are 4 instances of this issue._

### \[G‑10] State variables should be cached in stack variables rather than re-reading them from storage

The instances below point to the second+ access of a state variable within a function. Caching of a state variable replaces each Gwarmaccess (**100 gas**) with a much cheaper stack read. Other less obvious fixes/optimizations include having local memory caches of state variable structs, or having local caches of state variable contracts/addresses.

_There are 11 instances of this issue._

### \[G‑11] Modification of `getX()`, `setX()`, `deleteX()`, `addX()` and `subX()` in `BaseAbstract.sol` increases gas savings in \[G‑10]

Modify the `getX()`, `setX()`, `deleteX()`, `addX()` and `subX()` functions in `BaseAbstract.sol` to receive the address of the `Storage` contract as an argument. This modification will create dozens more fixable instances of \[G‑10].

_There are 116 instances of this issue._

### \[G‑12] `<x> += <y>` costs more gas than `<x> = <x> + <y>` for state variables (`-=` too)

Using the addition operator instead of plus-equals saves [**113 gas**](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/cbbfb267425b898e5be734d4008d4fe8). Subtructions act the same way.

_There are 12 instances of this issue._

### \[G‑13] Division by two should use bit shifting

`<x> / 2` is the same as `<x> >> 1`. While the compiler uses the `SHR` opcode to accomplish both, the version that uses division incurs an overhead of [**20 gas**](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/ec0e4e6c4f52a6bca158f137a3afd4ff) due to `JUMP`s to and from a compiler utility function that introduces checks which can be avoided by using `unchecked {}` around the division by two.

_There is 1 instance of this issue:_

```solidity
File: contracts\contract\MinipoolManager.sol

413 		uint256 avaxHalfRewards = avaxTotalRewardAmt / 2;
```

### \[G‑14] The result of function calls should be cached rather than re-calling the function

The instances below point to the second+ call of the function within a single function. _Every_ external call made to a contract incurs at least **100 gas** of overhead.

_There are 2 instances of this issue._

### \[G‑15] Don't compare boolean expressions to boolean literals

`if (<x> == true)` => `if (<x>)`, `if (<x> == false)` => `if (!<x>)`.

_There are 3 instances of this issue._

### \[G‑16] Splitting `require()` statements that use `&&` saves gas

See [this issue](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-xdefi-findings/issues/128) which describes the fact that there is a larger deployment gas cost, but with enough runtime calls, the change ends up being cheaper by **3 gas**.

_There is 1 instance of this issue:_

```solidity
File: contracts\contract\tokens\upgradeable\ERC20Upgradeable.sol

154 			require(recoveredAddress != address(0) && recoveredAddress == owner, "INVALID_SIGNER");
```

### \[G‑17] Stack variable used as a cheaper cache for a state variable is only used once

If the variable is only accessed once, it's cheaper to use the state variable directly that one time, and save the **3 gas** the extra stack assignment would spend.

_There are 3 instances of this issue._

> This wasn't what I meant. I meant that each of these functions accesses the `gogoStorage` state variable (SLOAD). Therefore, when there's more than one call to this group of functions (for example, `setUint()` followed by another `setUint()`, or `setUint()` followed by `getAddress()`), it would me much cheaper to cache that state variable (`gogoStorage`) and pass it to the these functions. This way, there will be only one SLOAD.

> In my gas report, I flagged the second+ calls to this group of functions as instances, since this optimization can spare an SLOAD in each of these calls. There are 116 instances, each saves 100 gas (like in G-10) - meaning a total saving of 11600 gas.

## Mitigation Review

### Introduction

Following the C4 audit contest, 3 wardens ([hansfriese](https://twitter.com/hansfriese), RaymondFam, and [ladboy233](https://twitter.com/Xc1008Cu)) reviewed the mitigations for all identified issues. Additional details can be found within the [C4 GoGoPool Versus Mitigation Review contest repository](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-02-gogopool-mitigation-contest).

### Overview of Changes

**Summary from the Sponsor:**

> Here's our biggest changes to look out for:
>
> 1. Minipool State Machine - We've tightened up the allowed state transitions including a new recreate minipool method that's atomic and doesn't allow node ops to withdraw funds or hijack a minipool.
> 2. Tracking AVAX High Water - Our previous system forced some tradeoffs to which AVAX is calculated in HighWater. We added a new variable `AVAXValidating` which tracks amount of AVAX actually validating on the P-Chain, and High Water is simply the highest validating amount during the period.
> 3. TokenGGP - Changed how tokens are inflated to actually mint rather than track tokens in the ProtocolDAO
> 4. Contract Upgrades - We're now able to upgrade as expected, to a contract with the same name as the existing contract
> 5. Upgradeable Tokens - ERC20Upgradeable takes a variable version for it's domain separator and we added storage gaps across the board

### [\[MR:M-01\] The node operators are likely to be slashed in an unfair way](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-02-gogopool-mitigation-contest-findings/issues/23)

_Submitted by hansfriese_

#### Original Issue

H-04: [Hijacking of node operators minipool causes loss of staked funds](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool-findings/issues/213)

#### Comments

In the original implementation, the protocol had some unnecessary state transitions and it was possible for node operators to interfere the recreation process.\
The main problem was the `recordStakingEnd()` and `recreateMiniPool()` were separate external functions and the operator could frontrun the `recreateMiniPool()` and call `withdrawMinipoolFunds()`.

#### Mitigation

[PR #23](https://github.com/multisig-labs/gogopool/pull/23)\
The mitigation added a new function `recordStakingEndThenMaybeCycle()` and handled `recordStakingEnd()` and `recreateMiniPool()` in an atomic way.\
With this mitigation, the state flow is now as below and it is impossible for a node operator to interfere the recreation process.\
![Imgur](https://imgur.com/JCoiCvl.jpg) But this mitigation created another minor issue that the node operators have risks to be slashed in an unfair way.

#### New issue

The node operators are likely to be slashed in an unfair way

#### Code snippet

https://github.com/multisig-labs/gogopool/blob/4bcef8b1d4e595c9ba41a091b2ebf1b45858f022/contracts/contract/MinipoolManager.sol#L464

#### Proof of concept

In the previous implementation, I assumed rialtos are smart enough to recreate minipools only when it's necessary.\
But now, the recreation process is included as an optional way in the `recordStakingEndThenMaybeCycle()`, so as long as the check `initialStartTime + duration > block.timestamp` at L#464 passes, recreation will be processed.

Now let us consider the timeline. One validation cycle in the whole sense contains several steps as below. ![Imgur](https://imgur.com/p6xWqgC.jpg)

1. Let us assume it is somehow possible that `startTime[1] > endTime[0]`, i.e., the multisig failed to start the next cycle at the exact the same timestamp to the previous end time. This is quite possible due to various reasons because there are external processes included. In this case the timeline will look as below.\
   ![Imgur](https://imgur.com/e292GIO.jpg) As an extreme example, let us say the node operator created a minipool with duration of 42 days (with 3 cycles in mind) and it took 12 days to start the second cycle. When the `recordStakingEndThenMaybeCycle()` (finishing the second cycle) was called, two cases are possible.

* It is possible that the `initialStartTime + duration <= block.timestamp`. In this case, the protocol will not start the next cycle. And the node validation was done for two cycles different to the initial plan.
* If `initialStartTime + duration > block.timestamp`, the protocol will start the third cycle. But on the end of that cycle, it is likely that the node is not eligible for reward by the Avalanche validators voting. (Imagine the node op lent a server for 42 days, then 42-14\*2-12=2 days from the third cycle start the node might have stopped working and does not meet the 80% uptime condition) Then the node operator will be punished and GGP stake will be slashed. This is unfair.

2. Assume it is 100% guaranteed that `startTime[n+1]=endTime[n]` for all cycles.\
   The timeline will look as below and we can say the second case of the above scenario still exists if the node operator didn't specify the duration to be a complete multiple of 14 days. (365 days is not!)\
   ![Imgur](https://imgur.com/tGHnMTL.jpg) Then the last cycle end will be later than `initialStartTime + duration` and the node op can be slashed in an unfair way again.\
   So even assuming the perfect condition, the protocol works in kind of unfair way for node operators.

The main reason of this problem is that technically there exists two timelines. And the protocol does not track the actual validation duration that the node was used accurately.\
At least, the protocol should not start a new cycle if `initialStartTime + duration < block.timestamp + 14 days` because it is likely that the node operator get punished at the end of that cycle.

#### Recommended additional mitigation

* If it is 100% guaranteed that `startTime[n+1]=endTime[n]` for all cycles, I recommend starting a new cycle only if `initialStartTime + duration < block.timestamp + 14 days`.
* If not, I suggest adding a new state variable that will track the actual validation period (actual utilized period).

#### Conclusion

Mitigation error - created another issue for the same edge case.

### [\[MR:M-02\] Deficiency of slashed GGP amount should be made up from node operator's AVAX](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-02-gogopool-mitigation-contest-findings/issues/6)

_Submitted by RaymondFam, also found by_ [_hansfriese_](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-02-gogopool-mitigation-contest-findings/issues/25) _and_ [_ladboy233_](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-02-gogopool-mitigation-contest-findings/issues/61)

https://github.com/multisig-labs/gogopool/blob/9ad393c825e6ac32f3f6c017b4926806a9383df1/contracts/contract/MinipoolManager.sol#L731-L733

#### Original Issue

H-06: [MinipoolManager: node operator can avoid being slashed](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool-findings/issues/136)

#### Impact

If staked GGP doesn't cover slash amount, slashing it all will not be fair to the liquid stakers. Slashing is rare, and that the current 14 day validation cycle which is typically 1/26 of the minimum amount of GGP staked is unlikely to bump into this situation unless there is a nosedive of GGP price in AVAX. The deficiency should nonetheless be made up from `avaxNodeOpAmt` should this unfortunate situation happen.

#### Proof of Concept

[File: MinipoolManager.sol#L731-L733](https://github.com/multisig-labs/gogopool/blob/9ad393c825e6ac32f3f6c017b4926806a9383df1/contracts/contract/MinipoolManager.sol#L731-L733)

```solidity
		if (staking.getGGPStake(owner) < slashGGPAmt) {
			slashGGPAmt = staking.getGGPStake(owner);
		}
```

As can be seen from the code block above, in extreme and unforeseen cases, the difference between `staking.getGGPStake(owner)` and `slashGGPAmt` can be significant. Liquid stakers would typically and ultimately care about how they are going to be adequately compensated with, in AVAX preferably.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider having the affected if block refactored as follows:

```diff
		Staking staking = Staking(getContractAddress("Staking"));
		if (staking.getGGPStake(owner) < slashGGPAmt) {
			slashGGPAmt = staking.getGGPStake(owner);

+			uint256 diff = slashGGPAmt - staking.getGGPStake(owner);
+			Oracle oracle = Oracle(getContractAddress("Oracle"));
+			(uint256 ggpPriceInAvax, ) = oracle.getGGPPriceInAVAX();
+			uint256 diffInAVAX = diff.mulWadUp(ggpPriceInAvax);
+                       staking.decreaseAVAXStake(owner, diffInAVAX);
+			Vault vault = Vault(getContractAddress("Vault"));
+			vault.transferAVAX("ProtocolDAO", diffInAVAX);

		}
```

> As the warden pointed out, this event is very unlikely. I think that it is a reasonable risk for the protocol to take. Slashing does not exist in Avalanche, you simply get rewards or do not, so personally, I don't think slashing their AVAX would be a good solution as it goes against Avalanche practices. Will bring it up to the team to see what they think.

### [\[MR:M-03\] `amountAvailableForStaking()` not fully utilized with `compoundedAvaxNodeOpAmt` easily forfeited](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-02-gogopool-mitigation-contest-findings/issues/52)

_Submitted by RaymondFam_

https://github.com/multisig-labs/gogopool/blob/3b5ab1d6505ef9be6197c4056acd38d6bed4aff6/contracts/contract/tokens/TokenggAVAX.sol#L134-L146\
https://github.com/multisig-labs/gogopool/blob/3b5ab1d6505ef9be6197c4056acd38d6bed4aff6/contracts/contract/MinipoolManager.sol#L497-L505

#### Original Issue

M-08: [Recreated pools receive a wrong AVAX amount due to miscalculated compounded liquid staker amount](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool-findings/issues/620)

#### Impact

The mitigated step is implemented at the expense of economic loss to both the node operators and the liquid stakers if `compoundedAvaxNodeOpAmt <= ggAVAX.amountAvailableForStaking()`.

#### Proof of Concept

Here is a typical scenario:

1. The protocol now assumes that a 1:1 nodeOp:liqStaker funds ratio is guaranteed to be met because of the atomic transaction that has also been implemented.
2. This is deemed an edge case that will only be optimally utilized if `compoundedAvaxAmt == ggAVAX.amountAvailableForStaking()`.
3. The atomic transaction is going to fail if `compoundedAvaxAmt > ggAVAX.amountAvailableForStaking()` after all due to situations like liquid stakers have been actively calling [`withdrawAVAX()`](https://github.com/multisig-labs/gogopool/blob/3b5ab1d6505ef9be6197c4056acd38d6bed4aff6/contracts/contract/tokens/TokenggAVAX.sol#L196-L205).

Under normal circumstances, [`ggAVAX.amountAvailableForStaking()`](https://github.com/multisig-labs/gogopool/blob/3b5ab1d6505ef9be6197c4056acd38d6bed4aff6/contracts/contract/tokens/TokenggAVAX.sol#L134-L146) is going to be adequate enough to cater for `compoundedAvaxNodeOpAmt`. This should not be easily forfeited without first checking whether or not `ggAVAX.amountAvailableForStaking()` is greater than `compoundedAvaxNodeOpAmt`.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider implementing the following check in `recreateMinipool()` to get the best out of it:

[File: MinipoolManager.sol#L486-L517](https://github.com/multisig-labs/gogopool/blob/3b5ab1d6505ef9be6197c4056acd38d6bed4aff6/contracts/contract/MinipoolManager.sol#L486-L517)

```diff
	function recreateMinipool(address nodeID) internal whenNotPaused {
		int256 minipoolIndex = onlyValidMultisig(nodeID);
		Minipool memory mp = getMinipool(minipoolIndex);
		MinipoolStatus currentStatus = MinipoolStatus(mp.status);

		if (currentStatus != MinipoolStatus.Withdrawable) {
			revert InvalidStateTransition();
		}

+                uint256 compoundedAvaxAmt;
+                uint256 rewardAmt;
+		if (mp.avaxNodeOpAmt + mp.avaxNodeOpRewardAmt <= ggAVAX.amountAvailableForStaking()) {
+                        compoundedAvaxAmt = mp.avaxNodeOpAmt + mp.avaxNodeOpRewardAmt;
+                        rewardAmt = mp.avaxNodeOpRewardAmt;
+                } else {
+                        compoundedAvaxAmt = mp.avaxNodeOpAmt + mp.avaxLiquidStakerRewardAmt;
+                        rewardAmt = mp.avaxLiquidStakerRewardAmt;
+                }

		// Compound the avax plus rewards
		// NOTE Assumes a 1:1 nodeOp:liqStaker funds ratio
-		uint256 compoundedAvaxAmt = mp.avaxNodeOpAmt + mp.avaxLiquidStakerRewardAmt;
		setUint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("minipool.item", minipoolIndex, ".avaxNodeOpAmt")), compoundedAvaxAmt);
		setUint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("minipool.item", minipoolIndex, ".avaxLiquidStakerAmt")), compoundedAvaxAmt);

		Staking staking = Staking(getContractAddress("Staking"));
		// Only increase AVAX stake by rewards amount we are compounding
		// since AVAX stake is only decreased by withdrawMinipool()
-		staking.increaseAVAXStake(mp.owner, mp.avaxLiquidStakerRewardAmt);
+		staking.increaseAVAXStake(mp.owner, rewardAmt);
		staking.increaseAVAXAssigned(mp.owner, compoundedAvaxAmt);

		if (staking.getRewardsStartTime(mp.owner) == 0) {
			// Edge case where calculateAndDistributeRewards has reset their rewards time even though they are still cycling
			// So we re-set it here to their initial start time for this minipool
			staking.setRewardsStartTime(mp.owner, mp.initialStartTime);
		}

		ProtocolDAO dao = ProtocolDAO(getContractAddress("ProtocolDAO"));
		uint256 ratio = staking.getCollateralizationRatio(mp.owner);
		if (ratio < dao.getMinCollateralizationRatio()) {
			revert InsufficientGGPCollateralization();
		}

		resetMinipoolData(minipoolIndex);

		setUint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("minipool.item", minipoolIndex, ".status")), uint256(MinipoolStatus.Prelaunch));

		emit MinipoolStatusChanged(nodeID, MinipoolStatus.Prelaunch);
	}
```

### [\[MR:M-04\] There is no way to retrieve the rewards from the MultisigManager and rewards are locked in the vault](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-02-gogopool-mitigation-contest-findings/issues/46)

_Submitted by hansfriese, also found by_ [_ladboy233_](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-02-gogopool-mitigation-contest-findings/issues/8)

#### Original Issue

M-21: [Division by zero error can block RewardsPool#startRewardCycle if all multisig wallet are disabled](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool-findings/issues/143)

#### Comments

The protocol provides an external function `startRewardsCycle()` so that anyone can start a new reward cycle if necessary.\
Before mitigation, there was an edge case where this function will revert due to division by zero. Edge case: there are no multisigs enabled. (possible when `Ocyticus.disableAllMultisigs(), Ocyticus.pauseEverything()` is called)

#### Mitigation

[PR #37](https://github.com/multisig-labs/gogopool/pull/37)\
If no multisig is enabled, the mitigation sends the rewards to the `MultisigManager` and it makes sense.\
But this created another issue. There is no way to retrieve the rewards back from the `MultisigManager`.

#### New issue

There is no way to retrieve the rewards from the `MultisigManager` and rewards are locked in the vault.

#### Code snippet

https://github.com/multisig-labs/gogopool/blob/4bcef8b1d4e595c9ba41a091b2ebf1b45858f022/contracts/contract/RewardsPool.sol#L229

#### Impact

There is no way to retrieve the rewards from the `MultisigManager` and rewards are locked in the vault.

#### Proof of Concept

The rewards that were accrued in this specific edge case are locked in the `MultisigManager`.\
It is understood that the funds are not lost and the protocol can be upgraded with a new `MultisigManager` contract with a proper function.\
I evaluate the severity of the new issue as Medium because funds are locked in some specific edge cases and only withdrawable after contract upgrades.

#### Recommended additional mitigation

Add a new external function in the `MultisigManager` with `guardianOrSpecificRegisteredContract("Ocyticus", msg.sender)` modifier and distribute the pending rewards to the active multisigs.

#### Conclusion

Mitigation error - created another issue for the same edge case.
