## 1 Executive Summary

Zellic conducted an audit for Multisig Labs from November 14th to 29th, 2022.

Our general overview of the code is that it was well-organized and structured. The code coverage is high, and tests are included for the majority of the functions. Some areas of the code have limited negative testing, which could be improved. The documentation was adequate, although it could be improved. The code was easy to comprehend, and in most cases, intuitive.

Zellic thoroughly reviewed the GoGoPool codebase to find protocol-breaking bugs as defined by the documentation and to find any technical issues outlined in the Methodology section (2.2) of this document.

Specifically, taking into account GoGoPool‚Äôs threat model, we focused heavily on issues that would break core invariants such as the management of the minipools, staking, withdrawing and minting shares, and the states of the Storage contract.

During our assessment on the scoped GoGoPool contracts, we discovered seven findings. Of the seven findings, four were of high severity, one was of medium severity, one was of low severity and the remaining finding was informational.

Additionally, Zellic recorded its notes and observations from the audit for Multisig Labs‚Äôs benefit in the Discussion section [( 4 )](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] at the end of the document.

## 2 Introduction

### 2.1 About GoGoPool

GoGoPool allows Avalanche users to stake a minimum of 0.01 AVAX and operate a validator node with a minimum of 1000 AVAX, while providing instant liquidity and earning rewards for validating subnets. As an open protocol, any individual, business, or subnet can plug into the protocol without being charged platform fees.

### 2.2 Methodology

During a security assessment, Zellic works through standard phases of security auditing including both automated testing and manual review. These processes can vary significantly per engagement, but the majority of the time is spent on a thorough manual review of the entire scope.

Alongside a variety of open-source tools and analyzers used on an as-needed basis, Zellic focuses primarily on the following classes of security and reliability issues:

**Basic coding mistakes.** Many critical vulnerabilities in the past have been caused by simple, surface-level mistakes that could have easily been caught ahead of time by code review. We analyze the scoped smart contract code using automated tools to quickly sieve out and catch these shallow bugs. Depending on the engagement, we may also employ sophisticated analyzers such as model checkers, theorem provers, fuzzers, and so forth as necessary. We also perform a cursory review of the code to familiarize ourselves with the contracts.

**Business logic errors.** Business logic is the heart of any smart contract application. We manually review the contract logic to ensure that the code implements the expected functionality as specified in the platform‚Äôs design documents. We also thoroughly examine the specifications and designs themselves for inconsistencies, flaws, and vulnerabilities. This involves use cases that open the opportunity for abuse, such as flawed tokenomics or share pricing, arbitrage opportunities, and so forth.

**Complex integration risks.** Several high-profile exploits have not been the result of any bug within the contract itself; rather, they are an unintended consequence of the contract‚Äôs interaction with the broader DeFi ecosystem. We perform a meticulous review of all of the contract‚Äôs possible external interactions and summarize the associated risks: for example, flash loan attacks, oracle price manipulation, MEV/sandwich attacks, and so forth.

**Codematurity.** We review for possible improvements in the codebase in general. We look for violations of industry best practices and guidelines and code quality standards. We also provide suggestions for possible optimizations, such as gas optimization, upgradeability weaknesses, centralization risks, and so forth.

For each finding, Zellic assigns it an impact rating based on its severity and likelihood. There is no hard-and-fast formula for calculating a finding‚Äôs impact; we assign it on a case-by-case basis based on our professional judgment and experience. As one would expect, both the severity and likelihood of an issue affect its impact; for instance, a highly severe issue‚Äôs impact may be attenuated by a very low likelihood. We assign the following impact ratings (ordered by importance): Critical, High, Medium, Low, and Informational.

Similarly, Zellic organizes its reports such that the most important findings come first in the document rather than being ordered on impact alone. Thus, we may sometimes emphasize an ‚ÄúInformational‚Äù finding higher than a ‚ÄúLow‚Äù finding. The key distinction is that although certain findings may have the same impact rating, their importance may differ. This varies based on numerous soft factors, such as our clients‚Äô threat models, their business needs, their project timelines, and so forth. We aim to provide useful and actionable advice to our partners that consider their long-term goals rather than simply provide a list of security issues at present.

## 3 Detailed Findings

### 3.1 The `transferAVAX` function allows arbitrary transfers

* **Target** : Vault.sol
* **Category** : Business Logic
* **Likelihood** : Medium
* **Severity** : High
* **Impact** : **High**

#### Description

The `transferAVAX` function is used to perform transfers of avax between two registered contracts.

```solidity
function transferAVAX (
    string memory fromContractName,
    string memory toContractName,
    uint256 amount
) external onlyRegisteredNetworkContract{

    // Valid Amount?
    if (amount == 0 ) {
    revertInvalidAmount();
    }

    // Emit transfer event
    emit AVAXTransfer(fromContractName, toContractName, amount);

    // Make sure the contracts are valid, will revert if not
    getContractAddress(fromContractName);
    getContractAddress(toContractName);

    // Verify there are enough funds
    if (avaxBalances[fromContractName] < amount) {
        revert InsufficientContractBalance();
    }

    // Update balances
    avaxBalances[fromContractName] = avaxBalances[fromContractName] - amount;
    avaxBalances[toContractName] = avaxBalances[toContractName] + amount;
}
```

The current checks ensure that the `msg.sender` is a `registeredNetworkContract`; however, the function lacks a check on whether the `msg.sender` actually calls the function or not.

#### Impact

Due to the fact that `fromContractName` can be an arbitrary address, a presumably malicious `registeredNetworkCContract` can drain the avax balances of all the other registered contracts.

#### Recommendations

We recommend removing the `fromContractName` parameter altogether and ensuring that the funds can only be transferred by the caller of the function, `msg.sender`.

```solidity
// @audit-info doesn't exist in rocketvault
function transferAVAX (
    string memory fromContractName,
    string memory toContractName,
    uint256 amount
) external onlyRegisteredNetworkContract {

    // Valid Amount?
    if(amount=) 0 ) {
        revert InvalidAmount();
    }
    // Emit transfer event
    emit AVAXTransfer(msg.sender, toContractName, amount);

    // Make sure the contracts are valid, will revert if not
    getContractAddress(msg.sender);
    getContractAddress(toContractName);

    // Verify there are enough funds
    if (avaxBalances[msg.sender] < amount) {
        revert InsufficientContractBalance();
    }
    // Update balances
    avaxBalances[msg.sender] = avaxBalances[msg.sender] - amount;
    avaxBalances[toContractName] = avaxBalances[toContractName] + amount;
}
```

#### Remediation

The issue has been fixed by Multisig Labs in commit 84211f.

### 3.2 Ocyticus does not include the Staking pause

* **Target** : Ocyticus, Staking
* **Category** : Business Logic
* **Likelihood** : Medium
* **Severity** : High
* **Impact** : **High**

#### Description

The `pauseEverything` and `resumeEverything` functions are used to restrict access to important functions.

```solidity
function pauseEverything() external onlyDefender {
    ProtocolDAO dao = ProtocolDAO(getContractAddress(‚ÄúProtocolDAO‚Äù));
    dao.pauseContract(‚ÄúTokenggAVAX‚Äù);
    dao.pauseContract(‚ÄúMinipoolManager‚Äù);
    disableAllMultisigs();
}

/// @notice Reestablish all contract's abilities
/// @dev Multisigs will need to be enabled seperately, we dont know which  ones to enable
function resumeEverything() external onlyDefender {
    ProtocolDAO dao = ProtocolDAO(getContractAddress(‚ÄúProtocolDAO‚Äù));
    dao.resumeContract(‚ÄúTokenggAVAX‚Äù);
    dao.resumeContract(‚ÄúMinipoolManager‚Äù);
}
```

Apart from the `TokenGGAvax` and `MinipoolManager`, the `Staking` contract also makes use of the `whenNotPaused` modifier for its important functions. The paused state, will, however, not trigger at the same time with the `pauseEverything` call, since the `Staking` contract is omitted here, both for pausing and resuming.

#### Impact

Should an emergency arise, `pauseEverything` will be called. In this case, `Staking` will be omitted, which could put user funds in danger.

#### Recommendations

We recommend ensuring that the `Staking` contract is also paused in the `pauseEverything` function as well as un-paused in the `resumeEverything` function.

```solidity
function pauseEverything() external onlyDefender {
    ProtocolDAO dao = ProtocolDAO(getContractAddress(‚ÄúProtocolDAO‚Äù));
    dao.pauseContract(‚ÄúTokenggAVAX‚Äù);
    dao.pauseContract(‚ÄúMinipoolManager‚Äù);
    dao.pauseContract(‚ÄúStaking‚Äù);
    disableAllMultisigs();
}

/// @notice Reestablish all contract's abilities
/// @dev Multisigs will need to be enabled separately, we don't know which ones to enable
function resumeEverything() external onlyDefender {
    ProtocolDAO dao = ProtocolDAO(getContractAddress(‚ÄúProtocolDAO‚Äù));
    dao.resumeContract(‚ÄúTokenggAVAX‚Äù);
    dao.resumeContract(‚ÄúMinipoolManager‚Äù);
    dao.resumeContract(‚ÄúStaking‚Äù);
}
```

#### Remediation

The issue has been fixed by Multisig Labs in commit dbc499.

### 3.3 The reward amount manipulation.

* **Target** : ClaimNodeOp.sol
* **Category** : Business Logic
* **Likelihood** : Medium
* **Severity** : High
* **Impact** : **High**

#### Descriptions

A staker is eligible for the upcoming rewards cycle if they have staked their tokens for a long enough period of time. The reward amount is distributed in proportion to the amount of funds staked by the user from the total amount of funds staked by all users who claim the reward. But since the `rewardsStartTime` is the time of creation of only the first pool, and during the reward calculations all staked funds are taken into account, even if they have not yet been blocked and can be withdrawn, the attack described below is possible.

The attack scenario:

1. An attacker stakes ggp tokens and creates a minipool with a minimum `avaxAssignmentRequest` value.
2. The multisig initiates the staking process by calling the `claimAndInitiateStaking` function.
3. Wait for the time of distribution of rewards.
4. Before the reward distribution process begins, the attacker creates a new minipool with the maximum `avaxAssignmentRequest` value.
5. Initiate the reward distribution process.
6. Immediately after that, the attacker cancels the minipool with `cancelMinipool` function before the `claimAndInitiateStaking` function call and returns most part of their staked funds.

#### Impact

The attacker can increase their reward portion without actually staking their own funds.

#### Recommendations

Take into account only the funds actually staked, or check that all minipools have been launched.

#### Remediation

The issue has been fixed by Multisig Labs in commits c90b2f and f49931.

### 3.4 Network registered contracts have absolute storage control.

* **Target** : Project-wide
* **Category** : Business Logic
* **Likelihood** : Low
* **Severity** : High
* **Impact** : **High**

#### Description

The network-registered contracts have absolute control over the storage that all the contracts are associated with through the `Storage` contract. This is inherent due to the overall design of the protocol,which makes use of a single `Storage` contract eliminating the need of local storage. For that reason any `registeredContract` can `update` **any** storage slot even if it ‚Äúbelongs‚Äù to another contract.

```solidity
modifier onlyRegisteredNetworkContract() {
  if (booleanStorage[keccak256(abi.encodePacked(‚Äúcontract.exists‚Äù,
  msg.sender))] == false && msg.sender != guardian) {
    revertInvalidOrOutdatedContract();
  }
  _;
}

// ...
function setAddress (bytes32 key, address value) external onlyRegisteredNetworkContract {
  address Storage[key] = value;
}

function setBool (bytes32 key, bool value) external onlyRegisteredNetworkContract {
  boolean Storage[key] = value;
}

function setBytes(bytes32 key, bytes calldata value) external onlyRegisteredNetworkContract {
  bytes Storage[key] = value;
}
```

As an example, the setter functions inside the `Staking` contract have different restrictions for caller (e.g., the `setLastRewardsCycleCompleted` function can be called only by `ClaimNodeOp` contract), but actually the `setUint` function from it may be called by any `RegisteredNetworkContract`.

#### Impact

We believe that in a highly unlikely case,a malicious `networkRegistered` contract could potentially alter the entire protocol `Storage` to their will. Additionally, if it were possible to `setBool` of an arbitrary address, then this scenario would be further exploitable by a malicious developer contract.

#### Recommendations

We recommend paying extra attention to the registration of `networkContracts`, as well as closely monitoring where and when the `setBool` function is used, since the network registration is based on a boolean value attributed to the contract address.

#### Remediation

The issue has ben acknowledged by the Multisig Labs. Their official reply is reproduced below:

> While it is true that any registered contract can write to Storage, we view all of the separate contracts comprising the Protocol as a single system. A single entity (either the Guardian Multisig or in future the ProtocolDAO) will be in control of all of the contracts. In this model, if an attacker can register a single malicious contract, then they are also in full control of the Protocol itself. Because all of the contracts are treated as a single entity, there is no additional security benefit to be gained by providing access controls between the various contract‚Äôs storage slots. As a mitigation, the Protocol will operate several distributed Watchers that will continually scan the central Storage contract, and alert on any changes.

### 3.5 Oracle may reflect an outdated price

* **Target** : Oracle
* **Category** : Business Logic
* **Likelihood** : Medium
* **Severity** : Medium
* **Impact** : **Medium**

#### Description

Some functions at protocol-level make use of the `getGGPPriceInAvax`. This getter retrieves the `price`, which is set by the `Rialto` multisig.

```solidity
/// @notice Get the price of GGP denominated in AVAX
/// @return price of ggp in AVAX
/// @return timestamp representing when it was updated
function getGGPPriceInAVAX() external view returns (uint256 price, uint256 timestamp) {
  price = getUint(keccak256(‚ÄúOracle.GGPPriceInAVAX‚Äù));

  if(price == 0) {
    revert InvalidGGPPrice();
  }
  timestamp = getUint(keccak256(‚ÄúOracle.GGPTimestamp‚Äù));
}
```

Due to the nature of on-chain price feeds, `Oracles` need to have an as-often-as-possible policy in regards to how often the price gets updated. For that reason, the reliance on the `Rialto` may be problematic should it fail to update the `price` often enough.

#### Impact

Should the price be erroneous, possible front-runs may happen at the protocol level, potentially leading to a loss of funds on the user-end side.

#### Recommendations

We recommend implementing a slippage check, which essentially does not allow a price to be used should it have been updated more than x blocks ago.

#### Remediation

The finding has been acknowledged by the Multisig Labs team. Their official reply is reproduced below:

> The price of GGP is used in the Protocol to determine collateralization ratios for minipools as well as slashing amounts. If the price of GGP is unknown or out- dated, the protocol cannot operate. So our remediation for this will be to have a distributed set of Watchers that will Pause the Protocol if the GGP Price becomes outdated. At some point in the future the Protocol will use on-chain TWAP price oracles to set the GGP price.

### 3.6 Fields are not reset exactly after their usage

* **Target** : MinipoolManager
* **Category** : Business Logic
* **Likelihood** : Low
* **Severity** : Low
* **Impact** : Low

### Description

Due to the nature of the protocol, some fields are queried and used in one intermediary state of the application and then reset in the last state of the application. As an example, see the `avaxNodeOpRewardAmt` value, which is queried and used in `withdrawMinipoolFunds` (which can only be called in the `WITHDRAWABLE` stage)

```solidity
function withdrawMinipoolFunds(address nodeID) external nonReentrant {
  int256 minipoolIndex = requireValidMinipool(nodeID);
  address owner = onlyOwner(minipoolIndex);
  requireValidStateTransition(minipoolIndex, MinipoolStatus.Finished);
  setUint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(‚Äúminipool.item‚Äù, minipoolIndex, ‚Äú.status‚Äù)), uint256(MinipoolStatus.Finished));

  uint256 avaxNodeOpAmt = getUint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(‚Äúminipool.item‚Äù, minipoolIndex, ‚Äú.avaxNodeOpAmt‚Äù)));

  uint256 avaxNodeOpRewardAmt = getUint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(‚Äúminipool.item‚Äù, minipoolIndex, ‚Äú.avaxNodeOpRewardAmt‚Äù)));

  uint256 totalAvaxAmt = avaxNodeOpAmt + avaxNodeOpRewardAmt;

  Staking staking = Staking(getContractAddress(‚ÄúStaking‚Äù));
  staking.decreaseAVAXStake(owner, avaxNodeOpAmt);

  Vault vault = Vault(getContractAddress(‚ÄúVault‚Äù));
  vault.withdrawAVAX(totalAvaxAmt);
  owner.safeTransferETH(totalAvaxAmt);
  }
```

and then either reset in the `recordStakingEnd` function, to the new rounds‚Äô `avaxNodeOpRewardAmt`, or set to 0 in `recordStakingError`.

The protocol‚Äôs structure assumes that the way in which the states are transitioned through is consistent.

#### Impact

Should major changes occur in the future of the protocol,we suspect that some states that are presumably reset in an eventual state of the protocol may be omitted. This could in turn lead to unexpected consequences to the management of the minipool.

#### Recommendations

We highly recommend that once important storage states are used, they should also be reset. In this way, future versions of the protocol will have a solid way of transitioning without requiring additional synchronization of storage state.

#### Remediation

The issue has ben acknowledged by the Multisig Labs. Their official reply is reproduced below:

> The Protocol maintains some fields in `Storage` so that data such as `avaxNodeOpRewardAmt` can be displayed to the end user. The fields will be reset if the user relaunches a minipool with the same `nodeID` again in the future. This is by design.

### 3.7 Contracts can deposit arbitrary tokens in the Vault

* **Target** : Vault.sol
* **Category** : Business Logic
* **Likelihood** : Medium
* **Severity** : Low
* **Impact** : Informational

#### Description

Multiple functions from the `Vault` contract allow arbitrary tokens to be deposited and withdrawn by `networkRegistered` contracts. For example, see the `depositToken` function:

```solidity
function depositToken(string memory networkContractName, ERC20 tokenContract, uint256 amount) external guardianOrRegisteredContracts {
  // Valid Amount?
  if (amount == 0 ) {
    revert InvalidAmount();
  }
  // Make sure the network contract is valid (will revert if not)
  getContractAddress(networkContractName);

  // Get contract key
  bytes32 contractKey = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(networkContractName, address(tokenContract)));
  // Emit token transfer event
  emit TokenDeposited(contractKey, address(tokenContract), amount);
  // Send tokens to this address now, safeTransfer will revert if it fails
  tokenContract.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
  // Update balances
  tokenBalances[contractKey] = tokenBalances[contractKey] + amount;
}
```

#### Impact

As per the current implementation, there are no security implications. However, we consider that the `Vault` plays an essential role in the entire protocol, and thus we highly recommend fixing this issue for posterity.

#### Recommendations

Upon discussions with the Multisig Lab team, we settled that the best mitigation is `whitelisting` the `tokenContract` that are used in each function. This further allows flexibility and security in smoothly upgrading the `Vault` should it support more tokens. In that case, the mitigated version of the function could be:

```solidity
function depositToken(string memory networkContractName, ERC20 tokenContract, uint256 amount) external guardianOrRegisteredContracts {

  require(whitelisted[tokenContract], ‚ÄútokenContract not whitelisted‚Äù);

  if (amount == 0 ) {
    revert InvalidAmount();
  }

  // ...
```

#### Remediation

The issue has been fixed by Multisig Labs in commit 644e8e.

## 4 Discussion

The purpose of this section is to document miscellaneous observations that we made during the assessment.

### 4.1 The `rewardsCycleEnd` calculation.

The `rewardsCycleEnd` value from the `TokenggAVAX` contract should always be evenly divisible by `rewardsCycleLength`. This condition, however, is only met during the contract initialization, where the `rewardsCycleLeng` this initially calculated. The `rewardsCycleLength` is eventually recalculated inside the `syncRewards` function, but this time, there is no check whether the value is evenly divisible or not.

#### Remediation

The issue has been fixed by Multisig Labs in commit 556ac4.

### 4.2 Lack of checks.

1. The `calculateAndDistributeRewards` function from the `ClaimNodeOp` contract does not explicitly verify that the `stakerAddr` is a valid staker address.
2. Add a check that `rewardsPool.getRewardsCycleCount()` is not zero to the `calculateAndDistributeRewards` function from the `ClaimNodeOpcontract`.
3. The `registerMultisig` function in the `MultisigManager` contract does not check that the `multisig.count` value has reached 10 to ensure that `There will never be more than 10 total multisigs`, which is a comment on the `requireNextActiveMultisig` function.
4. The `recordStakingStart` function in the `MinipoolManager` contract does not validate that the `startTime` value is not greater than the current time.
5. The set `RewardsStartTime` function in the `Staking` contract does not validate that the `time` value is not greater than the current time or that it can be only the current time or 0.
6. The `getInflationAmt` in the `RewardsPool` contract does not process the case when the max amount of tokens are released (22\_500\_000, the total minted amount).

#### Remediation

The issue has been fixed by Multisig Labs in commit 878b2e.

### 4.3 The process of distributing ggp rewards

In order to receive a reward the staker must be registered for the required amount of time. But the current implementation of the protocol allows users to stake most of the funds immediately before distribution of the reward. The `isEligible` function verifies that the staker should be registered at least `ProtocolDAO`. `RewardsEligibilityMinSeconds` amount of seconds before the rewards cycle starts (this happens after the first minipool is created), but this check takes into account only the first staking, and the first staked amount may be minimal. Therefore, users can use this possibility to their advantage.

#### Remediation

The discussion point has been acknowledged by the Multisig Labs team. Their official reply is reproduced below:

> We acknowledge that this attack is possible and is a side effect of the nature of our rewards protocol and the short duration of validating on Avalanche. There is some cost and difficulty to exploiting this. It depends on one getting a large amount of GGP before a rewards cycle. If GGP is only available on one AMM, this would greatly move the price with no CEX to arbitrage against. The end result would most likely not be profitable to the attacker if their intention was to dump.

### 4.4 Checks-effects-interactions pattern

We recommend following the checks-effects-interactions pattern during the `claimAndRestake` function in the `ClaimNodeOp` contract by moving the `staking.decreaseGGPRewards(msg.sender, ggpRewards);` line above the external calls.

#### Remediation

The issue has been fixed by Multisig Labs in commit 750812.

### 4.5 Missing status update.

In `MinipoolManager` the `_cancelMinipoolAndReturnFunds` function should reset the `rewardsStartTime` if the `.minipoolCount` value for staker is zero.

#### Remediation

The discussion point has been acknowledged by the Multisig Labs team. Their official reply is reproduced below:

> We don‚Äôt think that resetting `rewardsStartTime` is the fix because of the scenario below.
>
> * Day 1: NodeOp1 creates minipool 1, and it gets launched. Reward startTime set to Day 1.
> * Day 14: Minipool 1 ends. mpCount = 0. But rewards is still Day 1 so we can get paid on day 28.
> * Day 15: NodeOp1 creates minipool 2, mpCount = 1
> * Day 15: NodeOp1 cancels it before launch. mpCount = 0. We can‚Äôt reset rewards time because we need to get paid on Day 28. We DO reset the `AVAXAssignedHighWatermark`, so the AVAX used for this cancelled minipool doesn‚Äôt count. Instead we remediated by splitting up `avaxAssignedHighWater` and `avaxAssigned` in this [PR](https://github.com/multisig-labs/gogopool-contracts/pull/181). Now the AVAX value used for rewards (`avaxAssignedHighWater`), will only be increased when the node is started in `recordStakingStart`.

The issue has been remediated by Multisig Labs in PR 181.

### 4.6 Unused variables

In `Storage`, the `intStorage` and `bytesStorage` mappings and related functions are not used and can be deleted.

#### Remediation

The issue has ben acknowledged by the Multisig Labs and they plan to use them in the future.

### 4.7 Contract upgrades

We recommend paying additional attention when upgrading the contracts. Should the same `Storage` be used, the contract itself might not be `re-initializable` since its storage would already be used by the previously initialized contract. For example, this could happen in the `RewardsPool` contract.

```solidity

function initialize() external onlyGuardian {
  if(getBool(keccak256(‚ÄúRewardsPool.initialized‚Äù))) {

```

Notice that the `RewardPool.initialized` will always be true after the first contract has been initialized.

#### Remediation

The issue has ben acknowledged by the Multisig Labs. Their official reply is reproduced below:

> This is by-design. This specific contract was built to ensure even if upgraded that the `InflationIntervalStartTime` and `RewardsCycleStartTime` values would not be overwritten.

### 4.8 IWithdrawer inheritance

In the `withdrawAVAX` function from Vault, it is assumed that msg.sender has inherited the `IWithdrawer` interface. We consider that there could be a check for this during the registration process, since in `Vault`, for example, `withdrawAVAX` cannot be used (it will revert) unless `msg.sender` has the `IWithdrawer` interface implemented beforehand.

#### Remediation

The discussion point has been acknowledged by the Multisig Labs team. Their official reply is reproduced below:

> We added methods to register, unregister and upgrade contracts to the Protocol Dao. We‚Äôll add a check to our deploy scripts to handle verifying that we inherit from IWithdrawer.

### 4.9 Protocol DAO setters range

In protocol DAO, setters that deal with rates should range from 0.0 - 1.0 ether. This is not directly enforced as of now. The same could be done for the rest of the setter functions in the contract.

#### Remediation

The issue has been fixed by Multisig Labs in commit f49931.

### 4.10 Leftover tokens in `RewardsPool`.

In the `startRewardsCycle`, the allotment each party is supposed to receive is calculated; however, due to the nature of the arithmetics, some tokens might be left out due to rounding errors.

#### Remediation

The issue has ben acknowledged by the Multisig Labs and they have determined that the amounts would not be significant.

## 5 Threat Model

The purpose of this section is to provide a full threat model description for each function.

As time permitted, we analyzed each function in the smart contracts and created a written threat model for some critical functions. A threat model documents a given function‚Äôs externally controllable inputs and how an attacker could leverage each input to cause harm.

### 5.1 File: `TokenggAVAX`

#### Function: `initialize()`

**Intended behavior:**

* Should initialize all state variables and function calls required for the contract to function.

**Branches and code coverage:**

**Intended branches:**

* Should be callable by anyone?
  * [ ] Test coverage
* Should be called after every upgrade.
  * [ ] Test coverage

**Negative behavior:**

* Shouldn‚Äôt allow 2 x calling this.
  * [x] Negative test?

**Preconditions:**

* Assumes it‚Äôs not callable by anyone, or that there‚Äôs no way someone can frontrun this transaction
* Assumes that the `Storage` is adequately configured (should be fine, since `guardian` role is assigned in the constructor, for the `msg.sender`)

**Inputs:**

* `asset`:
  * **Control** : full control
  * **Checks** : no checks
  * **Impact** : used as underlying asset for the vault
* `storageAddress`:
  * **Control** : full control
  * **Checks** : no checks
  * **Impact** : used as upgradeable storage contract.

#### Function: `receive()`

**Intended behavior:**

This function is used for receiving native tokens. It can be called only by the `asset` address.

**Branches and code coverage:**

**Intended branches:**

* Allow `asset` contract to send native tokens to contract.
  * [x] Test coverage

**Negative behavior:**

* It cannot be called from any other address.
  * [x] Negative test?

**Preconditions:**

* the `asset` should be set after `initialize` call

**Inputs:**

* `msg.value`:
  * **Control** : controllable
  * **Authorization** : no
  * **Impact** : -
* `msg.sender`:
  * **Control** : controllable
  * **Authorization** : `assert(msg.sender == address(asset));`
  * **Impact** : `only accept AVAX via fallback from the WAVAX contract`. Otherwise, the balance information may be out of sync.

**External call analysis**

There are no external calls here.

#### Function: `syncRewards()`

**Intended behavior:**

* Should ‚Äúdistribute rewards‚Äù to **TokenggAVAX** holders. Anyone may call this.

`lastSync` - time of last successful call to this function

`rewardsCycleEnd` - the time when the total reward will be available;

`totalReleasedAssets` - the full amount of available tokens for withdrawal + the last reward value from the previous cycle. If the reward was not withdrawn immediately after the end of the cycle when the function `syncRewards` is called for the next cycle, `lastRewardsAmt` value will be added to the value `totalReleasedAssets`, and this reward still will be available for withdrawal.

**Branches and code coverage:**

**Intended branches:**

* `rewardsCycleEnd` = deadline for next `rewardsCycle`
  * [ ] Test coverage
* `lastSync` = current timestamp
  * [ ] Test coverage
* `lastRewardsAmt\_` = to the amount that rewards will deplete from.
  * [x] Test coverage
* `totalReleasedAssets` is calculated correctly for the next cycle - not sure that it is calculated correctly because it happens differently during `initialize` call
  * [ ] Test coverage
* `lastRewardsAmt` is calculated for the next cycle if the new reward was deposited.
  * [ ] Test coverage
* if rewards didn‚Äôt deposit, the `lastRewardsAmt` will equal 0 for the next cycle
  * [ ] Test coverage
* `lastRewardsAmt` is calculated correctly and equals 0 for the first cycle
  * [ ] Test coverage
* if nothing changed since the past cycle `lastRewardsAmt` is calculated correctly and equals 0 and `totalReleasedAssets` was increased by the previous `lastRewardsAmt`
  * [ ] Test coverage
* current `block.timestamp` should be less than `rewardsCycleEnd`
  * [x] Test coverage

**Negative behavior:**

* It basically shouldn‚Äôt update unless stuff unless it‚Äôs really time to update stuff (see below)
  * [ ] Negative test?
* Shouldn‚Äôt allow calling unless the `rewardsCycle` has passed the `block.timestamp`.
  * [x] Negative test?

**Preconditions:**

* Assumes that the state variables (`lastRewardsAmt`, `lastSync`, `rewardsCycleEnd` and `totalReleasedAssets` are properly updated)
* Can be called by anyone.

**Inputs:**

**Function call analysis**

* `asset.balanceOf(address(this))`
  * **What is controllable?** The amount of returned value
  * **If return value controllable, how is it used and how can it go wrong?** It can grow if the asset is artificially pumped in the contract;
  * **What happens if it reverts, reenters, or does other unusual control flow?** Doesn‚Äôt revert.

#### Function: `totalAssets()`

**Intended behavior:**

* This function returns the total amount of underlying assets held by the vault.

**Branches and code coverage:**

**Intended branches:**

* After the current cycle ends and the new one starts, the `totalAssets` amount will contain the past `lastRewardsAmt` value.
  * [ ] Test coverage
* `totalAssets` is calculated correctly if the current cycle is going.
  * [ ] Test coverage
* If the current cycle ends and the new one doesn‚Äôt start, the `totalAssets` should be equal `totalReleasedAssets\_` + `lastRewardsAmt`
  * [ ] Test coverage

**Negative behavior:**

* There‚Äôs multiple types of uints there, should ensure that there‚Äôs no way that any of them can overflow and block the functionality of the contract.
  * [ ] Negative test?
* must not revert (as per eip4626)
  * [ ] Negative test?

**Preconditions:**

* Assumes `lastSync` is different than 0 (default value, which is never initialized)? this is missing
* assumes that `block.timestamp` is safecasted? just as in syncRewards (currently missing)

**Inputs:**

There aren‚Äôt input values here.

**Function call analysis**

There aren‚Äôt function calls here.

#### Function: `depositFromStaking()`

**Intended behavior:**

* Should allow converting `native` AVAX tokens to `wAVAX` (just like `wETH`)
* Allows to `MinipoolManager` contract return with drawn funds and deposit reward.
* It is assumed that, at first will be called `MinipoolManager.sol:createMinipool` function, which call `depositAVAX` and after that caller will be able to call `withdrawForStaking` for previously deposited value over `MinipoolManager.sol:claimAndInitiateStaking` and only after that `depositFromStaking` can be called over `recordStakingEnd` or `recordStakingError` functions from `MinipoolManager.sol`

**Branches and code coverage:**

**Intended branches:**

* the `asset` balance of the current contract will increase by the `msg.value` after the call
  * [ ] Test coverage
* `stakingTotalAssets` will decrease by the `baseAmt` value after the call
  * [ ] Test coverage
* `baseAmt` + `rewardAmt` should be equal `msg.value`
  * [ ] Test coverage

**Negative behavior:**

  * [x] Negative test?
* if `stakingTotalAssets` is less than `baseAmt` transaction will be rejected
  * [x] Negative test?

**Preconditions:**

* `stakingTotalAssets` should contain a value more or equal to `baseAmt`. It means that this value should have been withdrawn over `withdrawForStaking` function
* `msg.sender` should be approved for a call

**Inputs:**

* `msg.value`:
  * **Control** : controlled, but actually,it is the value from `getUint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(‚Äúminipool.item‚Äù, minipoolIndex, ‚Äú.avaxLiquidStakerAmt‚Äù)));`
  * **Checks** : should be equal `baseAmt` + `rewardAmt`
  * **Impact** : -
* `msg.sender`:
  * **Control** : only approved MinipoolManager contract
  * **Checks** : `onlySpecificRegisteredContract(‚ÄúMinipoolManager‚Äù, msg.sender)`
  * **Impact** : function should be called only from trusted `MinipoolManager` contract
* uint256 `rewardAmt`:
  * **Control** : partly controlled
  * **Checks** : `msg.value == baseAmt + rewardAmt`
  * **Impact** : -
* uint256 `baseAmt`:
  * **Control** : partly controlled
  * **Checks** : `msg.value == baseAmt + rewardAmt`
  * **Impact** : -

**Function call analysis**

* `IWAVAX(address(asset)).deposit{value: totalAmt}();`

  * [x] Negative test?
* if `asset.balanceOf(address(this))` is less than `assets` transaction will be rejected
  * [ ] Negative test?
* if `msg.sender` is not approved transaction will be rejected
  * [ ] Negative test?

**Preconditions:**

* Assumes that there has been some `depositFromStaking` beforehand.
* Assumes that the same `MinipoolManager` deposited the amount. And that there cannot be any issues should one deposit and someone else (with same role) withdraw.

**Inputs:**

* `assets`:
  * **Control** : full control
  * **Checks** : `assets > amountAvailableForStaking()`
  * **Impact** : arbitrary input for the amount of `assets` that are to be withdrawn from the `wAVAX`
* `msg.sender`:
  * **Control** : only approved MinipoolManager contract
  * **Checks** : `onlySpecificRegisteredContract(‚ÄúMinipoolManager‚Äù, msg.sender)`
  * **Impact** : since the caller can withdraw any amount of funds through this function, it is critically important that it is called only by a trusted contract.

**Function call analysis**

* `withdrawer.receiveWithdrawalAVAX{value: assets}();`
  * **What is controllable?** the `assets,withdrawer;` it basically calls the `receiveWithdrawalAVAX` on the `msg.sender`!!! Really important
  * **If return value controllable, how is it used and how can it go wrong?** there isn‚Äôt return value here
  * **What happens if it reverts, reenters, or does other unusual control flow?** reenters: no problems because the contract being called is trusted. reverts: no problems

#### Function: `depositAVAX` compare with `deposit()` from inherited

**Intended behavior:**

* Allows any user to deposit `AVAX` in exchange for `wAVAX`. It basically doesn‚Äôt transfer the `wAVAX` back to the user, it keeps it and issues shares to the user.

  * [x] Test coverage
* Should transfer the \`wAVAX back to the user.
  * [x] Test coverage

  * [x] Test coverage

**Negative behavior:**

* Shouldn‚Äôt issue more or less shares than intended.
  * [x] Negative test?

**Preconditions:**

* Assumes users would use this function to deposit, rather than depositing on their own.
* Assumes `previewDeposit` calculates the amount of shares correctly.

**Inputs:**

* `IWAVAX(address(asset)).deposit()`
  * **What is controllable?** `assets` - the amount of deposited native tokens
  * **If return value controllable, how is it used and how can it go wrong?** there isn‚Äôt return value here

* `previewDeposit()` & `convertToShares()`
  * **What is controllable?** `assets`- the amount of deposited native tokens
  * **If return value controllable, how is it used and how can it go wrong?** if there are any mistakes during shares value calculations, then caller will get more or less shares than expected. If more then caller will be able to drain other users funds, if less then caller will withdraw less native tokens that was deposited.
  * **What happens if it reverts, reenters, or does other unusual control flow?** no problems

#### Function: `withdrawAvax()` compare this with `withdraw()`from inherited

**Intended behavior:**

* Supposed to `withdrawwAVAX` on behalf of the `msg.sender`, and then transfer the native `AVAX` back to the `msg.sender`.

**Branches and code coverage:**

**Intended branches:**

* the `wavax` balance of the contract should decrease(by `assets`)
  * [x] Test coverage
* the `avax` balance of user should increase (by `assets`)
  * [ ] Test coverage
* the `shares` of the user should decrease (by `shares`)
  * [x] Test coverage

  * [x] Negative test?

**Preconditions:**

* Assumes there are no rounding errors in `previewWithdraw` or other similar arithmetic issues.
* Assumes that user has enough `shares` to actually withdraw enough `wAVAX`

**Inputs:**

* `assets`:
  * **Control** : full control; the amount of assets that the user `intends` to withdraw.
  * **Checks** : there is no check here, however, it‚Äôs assumed that `previewWithdraw` calculates the amount of shares properly,and then that `_burn` fails should the `msg.sender` not have enough shares to actually receive the amount of assets.
  * **Impact** : arbitrary input for the amount of `assets` that are to be withdrawn from the `wAVAX`
* `msg.sender`:
  * **Control** : any caller
  * **Checks** : must have the appropriate amount of shares
  * **Impact** : the caller will receive the appropriate amount of native tokens

**Function call analysis**

* `previewWithdraw(assets)`
  * **What is controllable?** the assets parameter;
  * **If return value controllable, how is it used and how can it go wrong?** return the amount of shares. In case of wrong calculations a caller can burn an excessive number of shares or, conversely, burn too few and receive disproportionately many native tokens.
  * **What happens if it reverts, reenters, or does other unusual control flow?** no problems
* `IWAVAX(address(asset)).withdraw(assets);`
  * **What is controllable?** the `assets` value; the `asset` address is state var

    * **Checks** : must have the appropriate amount of shares
  * **Impact** : the caller will receive the appropriate amount of native tokens

**Function call analysis**

* `previewRedeem(shares)`
  * **What is controllable?** the shares parameter;

### 5.4 File:BaseUpgradeable.sol

The contract is inherited from `BaseAbstract.sol` and `Initializable.sol` (@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol);

#### Function: `_BaseUpgradeable_init()`

Allows to initialize the `gogoStorage` storage address. The function is internal and can be called only once due to `onlyInitializing` modifier.

### 5.5 File: `Base.sol`

The contract is inherited from `BaseAbstract.sol`; The contract contains only constructor with initialization of `gogoStorage` address.

### 5.6 File: `BaseAbstract.sol`

#### Function: `setters()`

**Intended behavior:**

Allows you to make changes to the data stored in the shared storage. All function is internal, therefore, they cannot be called directly. But they are called from various functions from inherited contracts.

### 5.7 File: `Storage.sol`

#### Function: `setGuardian()`

**Intended behavior:** Allow to reassign the guardian address. But to complete this process the new guardian should call `confirmGuardian` function.

* After successful call the `guardian` address didn‚Äôt change.
  * [x] Test coverage

**Negative behavior:**

* Reject if `msg.sender` isn‚Äôt the guardian; check put in place.
  * [x] Negative test?

**Preconditions:**

`msg.sender` is current guardian.

**Inputs:**

* msg.sender:
  * **Control** : -
  * **Checks** : msg.sender != guardian
  * **Impact** : due to the guardian having a lot of control over the protocol, it‚Äôs critically important that an untrusted caller doesn‚Äôt have access to this function.

**Function call analysis**

There aren‚Äôt external calls here.

#### Function: `confirmGuardian()`

**Intended behavior:** Allow to reassign the guardian address. But to complete this process the new guardian should call `confirmGuardian` function.

**Branches and code coverage:**

**Intended branches:**

* After successful call the `guardian` address is equal to `msg.sender` and `newGuardian`.
  * [x] Test coverage

**Negative behavior:**

* Reject if `msg.sender` isn‚Äôt the `newGuardian`; check put in place.
  * [x] Negative test?

**Preconditions:**

**Inputs:**

* msg.sender:
  * **Control** : -
  * **Checks** : msg.sender !=newGuardian
  * **Impact** : due to the guardian having a lot of control over the protocol, it‚Äôs critically important that an untrusted caller doesn‚Äôt have access to this function.

**Function call analysis**

There aren‚Äôt external calls here.

#### Function: `setters()`

**Intended behavior:**

**Negative behavior:**

* Network registered contracts shouldn‚Äôt abuse the `booleanStorage[keccak256(a bi.encodePacked(‚Äúcontract.exists‚Äù, msg.sender))]` modifier. Basically once a contract is `whitelisted`, it can remove/register other contracts as `network` registered, or modify any other states altogether.
  * [ ] Negative test?

**Preconditions:**

* Assumes that `msg.sender` handles the states properly, and doesn‚Äôt have typos when reading/updating specific states. Basically allf unctions that interact with the getters/ setters/ deleters from other contracts should be extremely well tested.

At the time of our audit, the code was not deployed to mainnet Avalanche.

During our assessment on the scoped GoGoPool contracts, we discovered seven findings. Of the seven findings, four were of high severity, one was of medium severity, one was of low severity and the remaining finding was informational. Multisig Labs acknowledged all findings and implemented fixes.

This assessment does not provide any warranties about finding all possible issues within its scope; in other words, the evaluation results do not guarantee the absence of any subsequent issues. Zellic, of course, also cannot make guarantees about any additional code added to the assessed project after the audit version of our assessment. Furthermore, because a single assessment can never be considered comprehensive, we always recommend multiple independent assessments paired with a bug bounty program.

For each finding, Zellic provides a recommended solution. All code in these recommendations are intended to convey how an issue may be resolved (i.e., the idea), but they may not be tested or functional code.

Finally, the contents of this assessment report are for informational purposes only; do not construe any information in this report as legal, tax, investment, or financial advice. Nothing contained in this report constitutes a solicitation or endorsement of a project by Zellic.
