# ðŸª™ Tokenomics

## ggAVAX

`ggAVAX` is a liquid staking token issued to users who deposit `AVAX` into GoGoPool's staking pool. `ggAVAX` represents staked `AVAX` in GoGoPool, and it gains value against `AVAX` thanks to the native Avalanche validation yield and other yield-generating activities.

#### Benefits

* **Earn Staking Rewards**: Holding `ggAVAX` means your investment grows over time, mirroring native staking yield and other yield activities.
* **Stay Liquid**: No need to lock `AVAX` to earn yields. You can trade, sell, or use `ggAVAX` just like `AVAX`, making it a flexible option for participating in the broader DeFi ecosystem.

## GGP

`GGP` is an ERC20 token that serves as GoGoPool's protocol token. `GGP` facilitates users in becoming validators through minipools, combining user-contributed `AVAX` with liquid staking funds. To secure these funds, minipool operators back their commitment with a minimum of 100 `AVAX` worth of `GGP` tokens as collateral.

#### **Key Functions of GGP**

* **Staking and Rewards**: Minipool operators stake `GGP` as a form of insurance, ensuring their commitment to maintaining network uptime and security. The initial minimum stake is set at 10% of the `AVAX` staked amount, with the option to increase up to 150%. A higher stake in `GGP` enhances the minipool operator's potential rewards.
* **Compensation Mechanism**: Should a node operator fail to meet performance standards, resulting in a loss of rewards, the staked `GGP` serves as a compensation pool to affected stakers.
* **Governance Participation**: `GGP` token holders will have the ability to participate in the GoGoPool Protocol DAO, which allows members to propose and vote on a range of governance issues.
