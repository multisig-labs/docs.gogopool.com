# ‚è∞ Notifications

GoGoPool's notification system offers timely alerts on account activities such as upcoming rewards, minipool endings, and collateral levels. It sends timely reminders for scheduled events and provides urgent warnings if collateral falls below set thresholds, helping users maintain their investments and avoid potential penalties.

## Types of Notifications

#### **Scheduled Reminders and Alerts:**

* **Minipool Rewards Reminder:** Receive reminders about upcoming `GGP` rewards for active stakers and minipool operators, ensuring you never miss out on your earnings. This reminder is sent daily and does not repeat until the next occurrence.
* **Minipool Ending Reminder:** Get alerts when your minipool is nearing the end of its term. This reminder is sent daily and does not repeat until the next occurrence.

#### **Urgent Notifications:**

* **Node Health Status Warning**: Receive alerts if your validator's health drops below 90%, prompting you to check and maintain performance above the 80% threshold necessary for rewards.
* **Low Collateral Warning:** Get alerts when your collateral drops below 10%, risking your eligibility for `GGP` rewards. Notifications are checked hourly and repeated once a day as long as the issue continues.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
If your collateral ratio is below 10% once your next Minipool or rewards cycle ends, your active Minipools are at risk of termination, and you may lose eligibility for `GGP` rewards.
{% endhint %}

* **Approaching Low Collateral Warning:** Receive early warnings when your collateral is below 20%, helping you avoid any possible losses. Notifications are checked hourly and repeated every 5 days if the issue continues.

{% hint style="info" %}
Increasing your `GGP` stake enhances your rewards and reduces the risk of termination or reward losses due to negative price volatility.
{% endhint %}

#### **General Protocol Alerts:**

* **General Protocol Alert:** Important updates sent to all subscribers, covering essential protocol developments or urgent news.

## Setting Up Notifications

GoGoPool offers multiple channels to inform you about important updates and events related to your staking activities.

### In-app Notifications

Receive all notifications directly through the in-app notification panel. Protocol-related notifications are displayed under the **Protocol** tab and are accessible without connecting a wallet. When a wallet is connected, custom notifications specific to that wallet are shown under the **My Wallet** tab.
