# üåê What is Hypha

Custom blockchains are redefining what's possible in Web3‚Äîenabling faster transactions, lower fees, and scalable architectures tailored to specific use cases.

By launching an L1, projects can optimize performance, governance, and security features while retaining full control over their ecosystem. With Avalanche‚Äôs latest upgrade, **Avalanche9000**, this process is faster, more affordable, and highly customizable, reducing traditional barriers to entry.

Hypha's new tools support these new L1s by simplifying infrastructure management and connecting projects with quality validators, addressing the typical roadblocks that come with building a secure, decentralized network.

## Avalanche9000

Avalanche9000 is a major upgrade to the Avalanche ecosystem, designed to simplify and accelerate the creation of Avalanche L1s . One of the key innovations is [**ACP77**](https://github.com/avalanche-foundation/ACPs/blob/main/ACPs/77-reinventing-subnets/README.md), which removes the previously high staking requirement for validators, making it easier for more projects to launch and maintain their own blockchains. This reduces costs and enables faster finality, making it a game-changer for developers. Summary of Avalanche9000 is explained below:

* **Reduced staking requirement**: No more need for 2000 AVAX to participate as a validator.
* **Customizable Avalanche L1s**: Projects can now create their L1s with tailored staking, governance, and gas token models.
* **Seamless interoperability**: Avalanche Interchain Messaging facilitates easy communication between different Avalanche L1s in the ecosystem.
* **Shared liquidity**: Avalanche Interchain Messaging solves liquidity fragmentation, enabling a more connected and efficient network.
* **Faster, scalable launches**: New L1s can launch with lower costs, faster finality, and greater scalability.

## **The Challenges in Launching Your Own L1**

While Avalanche reduces the economic barriers, several challenges remain:

* **Infrastructure Complexity**: Launching an L1 requires ongoing infrastructure management, which can be a burden for teams lacking technical resources. New projects often need an experienced partner to handle these complexities.
* **Decentralized Security**: For projects committed to decentralization, sourcing reliable validators is crucial. Without a trusted validator network, maintaining security and decentralization becomes challenging.

## **How** Hypha **Solves These Issues**

Hypha's Sell-Stake-Validate framework addresses the key challenges of launching and sustaining L1s, providing a complete solution for the entire L1 lifecycle:

### Build Your L1 Community

[L1 Marketplace](https://l1s.gogopool.com/marketplace) connects your project with an established ecosystem of dedicated L1 supporters. We help you build a foundational community of stakeholders invested in your long-term success while launching your node license offering to an audience that truly understands L1 value creation.

* Generate initial backing with meaningful connections to early supporters
* Develop a sustainable community from day one through our proven platform

### Eliminate Staking Complexity

Our staking system removes technical barriers for your token holders. Participants can easily stake node licenses to validators with a straightforward, simplified process.

* Enable users to participate in network security without technical expertise
* Provide transparent reward tracking and performance monitoring through clear dashboards

### Access Professional Infrastructure

Our curated network of professional hardware operators eliminates infrastructure headaches. We provide turnkey validator deployment with ongoing maintenance while ensuring high uptime and optimal performance for your network.

* Handle all technical updates and security requirements so you don't have to
* Create a decentralized foundation of reliable validators from day one

Hypha's approach allows L1 projects on Avalanche to focus on building their ecosystem while we manage the complexities of node sales, staking systems, and validator infrastructure‚Äîhelping you unlock Avalanche's full potential.

For those looking to launch your own L1, we encourage you to get in touch. We're eager to support developers and visionaries in leveraging blockchain technology to its fullest potential.
