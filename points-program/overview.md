# Overview

The Hypha Points Program is a campaign designed to bootstrap the Hypha ecosystem and reward early community members.

### Program Objectives

The primary objective of this program is to bootstrap the initial **Total Value Locked (TVL)** of AVAX required to power the **Hypha L1 Framework**.

This framework, also known as the **Hypha Flywheel**, is a system designed to create deep economic alignment between **staked AVAX** and **new L1 chains on Avalanche**. It addresses the challenge of new L1s operating in silos, disconnected from the core network's liquidity and security.

The flywheel functions through the following mechanics:

* **Shared Economic Foundation**: It establishes `stAVAX` as a yield-bearing foundation that can be used by the entire ecosystem.
* **Yield Redirection**: Through smart contract extensions called **alignment plugins**, emerging L1s can access and redirect the yield from `stAVAX` to fund their own growth. For example, an L1 could use this yield to bootstrap liquidity for its DEX or incentivize its first set of validators.
* **Mutually Beneficial Cycle**: This creates a symbiotic relationship. New L1s get a sustainable source of funding for growth, and in return, their success increases the demand and utility for staked AVAX, strengthening the entire ecosystem.

The **Hypha Points Program** serves as the catalyst for this system. By participating, users provide the foundational TVL that makes this flywheel possible.

### P**oint System Basics**

* **What Points Represent**: Points are a measure of a user's contribution to the ecosystem's growth. They will be used to determine a user's share of future protocol rewards and incentives.
* **How Points Are Earned**: Points are earned by performing specific, onchain actions within the Hypha ecosystem, such as staking tokens or operating minipools.
